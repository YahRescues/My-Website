        <h1>Was Jesus buried?</h1>
   <p class="center">
    If Jesus was buried one either has to accept miracles and the resurrection, or reject miracles and say they don’t know what happened. The lack of the body in the tomb points to a resurrection. The case for the burial is as follows.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Early creeds stating a burial</h3>
<p class="center">By creeds is not meant the nicene creed, which is sometimes understood by the mention of the earliest creeds. In Paul's letters we see short statements which have been recognised by scholars to be creeds which Paul was referring to. One of these creeds is Romans 10:9-10, this makes the passage make a lot more sense. The significant creed for attestation of the burial is 1 Corinthians 15:3-7. Paul in his letter inserts himself at the end of the creed. There are a number of epistles of Paul which critical scholars accept as being genuine of Paul. 1 of these books is 1 Corinthians. 1 Corinthians 15, critically dated to the 50s, lays out the creed. “For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures” This is not only a creed from the 50s, but Paul says it was handed down to him and therefore has to have an earlier date. Scholars will accept that this creed was passed down within a decade of the crucifixion, some will accept 5 years. We don't say that a creed containing resurrection proves resurrection. But we do say that a creed containing burial proves it was believed that Jesus was buried.</p>
<h3>Stolen body theories</h3> 
<p class="center">We have theories arising in the early centuries that the body was stolen. These stories don’t just arise if the body was never buried. You can’t make a story about something which doesn’t exist. Nobody can suppose a flat earth theory if earth isn’t believed to exist, and you can’t make theories about a stolen body if it wasn’t buried. </p>
<h3>Resurrection meaning</h3> 
<p class="center">The meaning of a resurrection is to go down and come back up. The meaning of resurrection, which was believed by the early believers, contained in multiple early creeds, and wrote about in the accepted letters of Paul, doesn’t agree with the no burial theory</p>
<h3>Jewish acceptance</h3> 
<p class="center">Thousands of Jews in the first century accepted the gospel, the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus. Jews were called to visit Jerusalem 3 times a year, one of those times is Passover, this is when Jesus was crucified. How did any Jew who witnessed the crucifixion, and supposedly knew full well that this crucified victim was left on the cross, accept not only the death, but the burial and resurrection? How could any Jew accept it? Who would be so foolish to accept the burial of a man they knew was not buried? Who would be foolish enough to be willing to die for a man they knew wasn’t buried? These Jews would have seen that Jesus was crucified and left on the cross, if that was the case.</p>
<h3>Matthew's testimony</h3> 
<p class="center">We have testimony from Matthew in the first century that the stolen body theory was around. He writes to these Jews, in the first century, and speaks about the stolen body theory. Why would any of these Jews accept what he said? He also writes of the tomb of Joseph Arimathea. Are we to believe that these Jews accepted what they knew to be false? If there was no tomb, then Matthew would never have tried to convince Jews of a tomb in their location, which they knew did not exist.</p>
<h3>Jewish burial</h3> 
<p class="center">After these five one will still ignore what is said because of the logical conclusion, and insist on sticking to their belief of no burial because of a custom in Ancient Rome. The custom being that crucified victims are to be left on the cross. Whilst these customs were customs of ancient Rome, they don't tell us what happened in Judea during a time of peace. Rome didn't rule every area the same, Jews were given special privileges during these times of peace. Jews had a custom of giving a burial for dead bodies. We see this in Deuteronomy 21:22-23, and Josephus writes that they would take care in the burial of men that they took down those who were condemned and crucified and buried them. It is hoped by some that this last argument could disprove everything else. But the Jews were given a special agreement to give burials, and the denial of the burial of Jesus is a minority view among the scholars. Whilst there is a general consensus of the custom of ancient Rome, there is another consensus about the burial of a specific man in a specific location. </p>
<h3>Quotations</h3>
<p class="center">"Moreover Apion would lay a blot upon us, because we do not erect images for our emperors; as if those emperors did not know this before, or stood in need of Apion as their defender. He ought rather to have admired the magnanimity and modesty of the Romans, whereby they do not compel those that are subject to them to transgress the laws of their countries..."
<br>
Josephus, Against Apion, 2.73</p>
<p class="center">"...the Jews used to take so much care of the burial of men, that they took down those that were condemned and crucified, and buried them before the going down of the sun."
<br>
Josephus, Jewish War, 4.5.2</p>
<p class="center">"And thus it is that we bury all whom the laws condemn to die, upon any account whatever. Let our enemies that fall in battle be also buried; nor let any one dead body lie above the ground, or suffer a punishment beyond what justice requires."
<br>
Josephus, Antiquities, 4.265</p>
<p class="center">"I have known instances before now of men who had been crucified when this festival and holiday was at hand, being taken down and given up to their relations, in order to receive the honours of sepulture, and to enjoy such observances as are due to the dead; for it used to be considered, that even the dead ought to derive some enjoyment from the natal festival of a good emperor, and also that the sacred character of the festival ought to be regarded"
<br>
Philo, Flaccus, 83</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p class="center">Early creeds within a decade of the cross, the existence of stolen body theories, the meaning of the word resurrection, Jewish acceptance, Matthew's testimony to the audience he was writing to, and Jewish customs regarding a proper burial all point to the fact that Jesus was buried. The quotations clearly point out that Jews in Judea were permitted to carry out their customs, even the custom of burying dead bodies, and even those dead bodies that had been crucified. </p>
