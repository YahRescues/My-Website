    Say to say, there are large numbers in many congregations who have no light as to who Christ is and what He has done for them. How, then, can they have enough love to follow this Christ through hardship whom they do not even know?

    It is not the sharpness of the sword which kills, but the force with which it is plunged in. Thus the hypocrite can lay his sword so gently against sin in his own heart that it never feels a thing.

    But even if you could conceal this hypocrisy and enjoy a religious reputation until death, would it be a consellation to you in hell to know your friends were still commending your memory on earth?

    What more powerful thought can keep us true to God than His faithfulness to us? When you see that your heart is being warped into any insincere practice, consider this: if anything of God is in you, it can unbend that hypocrisy and melt and mold you into the right image again

    Joshua spoke his heart even when ten out of the twelve spies said what the people wanted them to say. And the false prophets' words which massaged Ahabs pride would not fit Micaiahs mouth. He chose to look ridiculous by standing alone rather than agreeing with 'four hundered men' who were unanimously wrong

    Sincerity does not guarantee we will not ever fall but it helps us up again when we do. The hypocrite, however, lies where he falls until he dies.

    The hypocrite is a Christian by outward appearance only, not by a new nature. A puppet looks like a man in his outward shape but is moved by the joints and hinges the workman fastens to it and it is not furnished with a soul of its own.When an image like this is worn by time or broken by violence, it cannot do anything to renew itself but crumbles away in pieces until at last it comes to nothing.Thus the hypocrites profession is wasted because he is without vital truth to withstand the ruin coming upon him

    The sincere man has the blessing of the promise to restore him when his spiritual condition starts to decay but the curse of God will destroy the hypocrite in all his pomp and glory

    Before a sermon, hypocrites talk a very spiritual language: 'whatever God says we will do' But when the sermon is finished they are farther from obeying Him than ever. The hypocrite hears, prays, and fasts, but all to his detriment.

    Unstable people let circumstances control how they feel - cheerful in sunshine but depressed in rain. And this is the way of the unsound heart. A few trying situations weaken his spirit and destroy him as a cold winter kills feeble bodies. Afflictions, however, help the Christian grow by uniting him even more closely with Christ. Trouble sends him straight to the arms of the Lord, as the bee flies to her hive in a storm. He is glad who has such a comfortable pillow as the lap of Jesus

    The hypocrite feeds on credit; he lives on what the breathe of mens praise gives him. WHen that fails, his heart aches with disappointment; but when acceptance turns to scorn he dies because he does not have the approval of God while being reproached by man

    Anyone who is so preoccupied with protecting his own name that he will not tolerate suffering for Christ or bear the muck thrown by reviling tongues must find a path to travel by himself to heaven

    It is a heart-aching trial for the minister who spends his strength for twenty years preaching the gospel to a mocking, ignorant, and profane congregation with no more life in them than the pews they sleep in. It costs the mother no small pain to bring forth a living child; but what about the anguish of one who labours to deliver one born dead? This is the travail of a minister with dead-hearted people

    In a word, when the flood comes rolling in upon a nation like irresistable waves through the wide breaches made by sin, and righteous men stand in the gap and beg for the life of the nation, God will not answer their cries. But even then, sincerity will be a sweet support if we must share in nationwide adversity.Even when the righteous are men beloved of God like Noah and Daniel, sometimes God still denies bail for a people under the arrest of His judgement

    If Gods Spirit is not at the root, no 'fruit of the Spirit' - holiness - can be found on the branches. (Gal 5:22) 'Sensual' and 'having not the Spirit' are inseperably coupled (Jude 19).

    All the personal ambitions of a sincere saint are swallowed up in this, that he may do the will of God in his generation. This is all his prayer - 'not my will, but thine, be done' (Luke 22:42) His sole purpose is to find and do the 'good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God' (Rom 12:2)

    The devil would rather see Christians defiled with sin and unrighteousness than defiled in blood and pain, for he has learned that persecution only trims the church, which soon comes right back up all the thicker; it is unrighteousness which ruins it. Persecutors, then, only plow God's field for Him and all the time He is sowing it with the saints blood.

    Follow peace ..., and holiness without which no man shall see the Lord' (Heb 12:14). Before Enoch was translated to heaven he walked the earth with God as a holy man; and this is why God wanted him in heaven with Him, for heaven is a city where righteousness dwells. Can we actually expect to get there when we do not care about keeping our behaviour holy or about exercising righteous acts of godliness? Certainly what God has written about holiness will stand; He shall never blot out or revise His word for anybody. So we must either renounce our hope of going to heaven or resolve to walk in the only path that will lead us there.

    Is this how you treat Him after all He has done for you? Is this a fair rewarding for all of His benefits which He has bestowed on you?

    He intends that Christians not only 'bear' it - for the ungodly manage to do this against their wills - but to take it up. Of course He does not mean for us to make our own cross and run headlong into trouble, but He does want us to take up that cross he has made for us. We should not step out of the way by any deceitful shift to escape trouble but accept the burden God has chosen as if He were doing us a favour to let us suffer for Him. No one stoops to pick up something that is worthless; but Christ asks His people to take up the cross the way a person takes up a pearl which lies on the ground in front of him.

    A heart full of grace will follow Jesus into the wilderness of affliction as willingly as a lover goes with her beloved into a quiet garden to enjoy his presence. By His Word and by His Spirit Christ satisfies the Christian, making him want to be with Him anywhere.

    When a person is finally brought to the foot of God and can earnestly surrender: ‘Lord, here I am, ready to give you all I am and all I have; my will shall be done when Your will has been done in me,’ then the Lord will oblige Himself to care for that soul
