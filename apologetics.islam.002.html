        <h1>
            Allah makes Jesus’ followers superior</h1>
   <p class="center">
    We  see in the Quran verses that Allah will make the followers of Jesus dominant ‘until the day of resurrection’. Either Allah was wrong, or Paul, and Constantine were made to succeed and be dominant by the help of Allah. Ibn Kathir says there was a group of Israelites accepted the guidance of Jesus and were give power of the Christians who defied them. We see clearly from Ibn Kathir that the religion of Constantine became superior. We would also have to say that Allah caused Paul to become superior with his message. If the true followers of Jesus were the ones who just thought he was a prophet, and a slave to Allah, and Allah was going to make them superior until the day of resurrection, then Muhammad wouldn’t have needed to correct anything of the Christians. He would be correcting the work of Allah who made the true believers dominant. For example, he couldn’t have come against the dominance of the trinity. The question then becomes why did Allah make Paul and Constantine superior to those who deemed Jesus (Isa) to be only a prophet? Why did Allah make Constantine superior in allowing the eating of pork? Why did Allah make Constantine superior in changing the direction of prayer to the east? Why did Allah make Constantine superior in changing the religion of Jesus? Ibn Kathir states there were 4 beliefs before Constantine, Jesus being only a prophet, Jesus being God's son but not God, Jesus being God but not the trinitarian belief, Jesus being God in the trinitarian belief. Out of the 4 beliefs Ibn Kathir mentions the one which became dominant was the Trinity. Why does Allah make the trinitarians dominant?  By saying that the religion of Jesus became the religion of Constantine, Ibn Kathir is conceding that Constantine was made dominant. Qushairi made it clear, he says there was a group of believers who believed in what Jesus really taught in his declaration of the Islamic idea of the oneness of God. These would be made superior until the day of resurrection.

    <h3>Quran 3:55</h3>
    <p class="center">
    [Mention] when Allāh said, "O Jesus, indeed I will take you and raise you to Myself and purify [i.e., free] you from those who disbelieve and make those who follow you [in submission to Allāh alone] superior to those who disbelieve until the Day of Resurrection. Then to Me is your return, and I will judge between you concerning that in which you used to differ.
    <br>
    <br>
   <h3>Quran 61:14</h3>
   <p class="center">
    O you who have believed, be supporters of Allāh, as when Jesus, the son of Mary, said to the disciples, "Who are my supporters for Allāh?" The disciples said, "We are supporters of Allāh." And a faction of the Children of Israel believed and a faction disbelieved. So We supported those who believed against their enemy, and they became dominant.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Tafsir Ibn kathir 61:14</h3>
    <p class="center">
    (We are Allah's helpers) meaning, `we will support you with regards to the Message you have been sent with and will help you convey it.' Whereby, `Isa sent the disciples to the various areas of Ash-Sham to call the Greeks and the Israelites to Islam
    <br>
    <br>
    (Then a group of the Children of Israel believed and a group disbelieved.) When `Isa, peace be on him, conveyed the Message of his Lord to his people and the disciples supported him, a group from the Children of Israel believed. They accepted the guidance that `Isa brought to them, while another group, was led astray. This group rejected what `Isa brought them, denied his prophethood and invented terrible lies about him and his mother. They are the Jews, may Allah curse them until the Day of Judgement. Another group exaggerated over `Isa, until they elevated him to more than the level of prophethood that Allah gave him. They divided into sects and factions, some saying that `Isa was the son of Allah, while others said that he was one in a trinity, and this is why they invoke the father, the son and the holy ghost! Some of them said that `Isa was Allah, as we mentioned in the Tafsir of Surat An-Nisa'.
    <br>
    <br>
    So, We gave power to those who believed against their enemies,) vthat is, `We gave them victory over the group of Christians which defied them,'
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Tafsir Ibn kathir 3:55</h3>
    <p class="center">
    And I will make those who follow you superior to those who disbelieve, till the Day of Resurrection)
    This is what happened. When Allah raised `Isa to heaven, his followers divided into sects and groups. Some of them believed in what Allah sent `Isa as, a servant of Allah, His Messenger, and the son of His female-servant. 
    <br>
    <br>
    However, some of them went to the extreme over `Isa, believing that he was the son of Allah. Some of them said that `Isa was Allah Himself, while others said that he was one of a Trinity. Allah mentioned these false creeds in the Qur'an and refuted them. The Christians remained like this until the third century CE, when a Greek king called, Constantine, became a Christian for the purpose of destroying Christianity. Constantine was either a philosopher, or he was just plain ignorant. Constantine changed the religion of `Isa by adding to it and deleting from it. He established the rituals of Christianity and the so-called Great Trust, which is in fact the Great Treachery. He also allowed them to eat the meat of swine, changed the direction of the prayer that `Isa established to the east, built churches for `Isa, and added ten days to the fast as compensation for a sin that he committed, as claimed. So the religion of `Isa became the religion of Constantine, who built more then twelve thousand churches, temples and monasteries for the Christians as well as the city that bears his name, Constantinople (Istanbul). Throughout this time, the Christians had the upper hand and dominated the Jews. Allah aided them against the Jews because they used to be closer to the truth than the Jews, even though both groups were and still are disbelievers, may Allah's curse descend on them.

    <h3>Abbas - Tanwîr al-Miqbâs min Tafsîr Ibn ‘Abbâs</h3>
    <p class="center">
    ((And remember) when Allah said: O Jesus! Lo! I am gathering thee and causing thee to ascend unto Me, and am cleansing) saving (thee of those who disbelieve) in you (and am setting those who follow you) follow your Religion (above those who disbelieve) with strong argument and triumph (until the Day of Resurrection)

     <h3>Kashani</h3>
     <p class="center">
    'I shall gather you, that is, I shall seize you unto Me from among them, and raise you to Me, that is, to the heaven of the spirit alongside Me, and I shall cleanse you of, the impurity of being alongside, those who disbelieved, from among the vile faculties and their scheming and [from] the vileness of their company; and I shall set those who follow you, of the spiritual ones, above those who disbelieved, of the ego-centric ones until the Day of the Greater Resurrection and the arrival at the station of the Unity.

     <h3>Qushairi - Al-Qushairi</h3>
     <p class="center">
    It is said that He purified his heart from looking to others aghyār and from seeing simulacra and traces al-amthāl wa-l-āthār in all states and phases al-aḥwāl wa-l-aṬwār. and I am setting those who follow you above those who disbelieved until the Day of Resurrection In help nuṣra force qahr and proof ḥujja. His followers-those who have not changed his religion dīn and those who follow his creed ʿaqīda in the declaration of oneness tawḥīd-are believers muÌminūn. They are in the right until the Day of Resurrection and they will be helped [by God] until the Day of Resurrection.
