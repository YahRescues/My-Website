    They know by experience that true Christianity is a union of the soul with God.
<br>
<br>
    External motivations are often very helpful for exciting and stirring up this inner source of life, especially when this new life has just begun or is in a weakened state. In these conditions, it is often so weak that a man is hardly even aware of its existence.
    <br>
    <br>
    If a person in such a weakened state is conscientious and consistent in his obedience, is sincerely groaning under the awareness of his condition, and desires to perform his duties with more enthusiasm and strength, the divine life is beginning to take

    Those who have given themselves completely to God will never think they do too much for Him.
    <br>
    <br>
    It is a “life which is hid with Christ in God.” Since it is hidden in God, it doesn’t have any glorious show or appearance in the world. To the natural man, it will be perceived as an inferior and unappealing notion.
    <br>
    <br>
    The root of the divine life is faith; the main branches are love to God, charity to man, purity, and humility.
    <br>
    <br>
    Love to God is a delightful and affectionate sense of God’s perfections. It makes the soul resign and sacrifice itself completely to him. It desires above all things to please him, and has its greatest delight in fellowship and communion with him. It is ready to do or suffer anything for his sake or at his pleasure. Though this affection may begin from the favors and mercies of God toward us, as it grows and matures, it transcends these concepts. It becomes rooted in his infinite goodness that is manifested in all the works of creation, and in all that he does.
    <br>
    <br>
    This is that charity I named as the second branch of religion. Under it, all the parts of justice and all the duties we owe to our neighbor are clearly included. He who truly loves the entire world will be equally concerned about the interests of everyone. Such a person will be so far from wronging or injuring anyone, that he will resent anything suffered by another, as if it happened to himself.
    <br>
    <br>
    Because of our individual personalities, habits, and desires in this world, we will find that some of the things that we discover to be sinful have been deeply wedded to our lives. We have become one with these to the extent that our turning from them will seem like cutting off our right hands or plucking out our right eyes.
    <br>
    <br>
    Let us, therefore, make a habit of serious consideration of what a fearful thing it must be to irritate and offend the infinite Being. He is the only one who can keep us from everlasting destruction and the one we depend on every moment. He can make us miserable by simply withdrawing his mercies or make us nothing by withdrawing his assistance.
    <br>
    <br>
    Considering these things from time to time is not enough. Neither is making resolutions about forsaking our sins. We must also maintain a constant guard and be continually watching against them.
