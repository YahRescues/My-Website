    They know by experience that true Christianity is a union of the soul with God.
<br>
<br>
    External motivations are often very helpful for exciting and stirring up this inner source of life, especially when this new life has just begun or is in a weakened state. In these conditions, it is often so weak that a man is hardly even aware of its existence.
    <br>
    <br>
    If a person in such a weakened state is conscientious and consistent in his obedience, is sincerely groaning under the awareness of his condition, and desires to perform his duties with more enthusiasm and strength, the divine life is beginning to take
    <br>
    <br>
    Those who have given themselves completely to God will never think they do too much for Him.
    <br>
    <br>
    It is a “life which is hid with Christ in God.” Since it is hidden in God, it doesn’t have any glorious show or appearance in the world. To the natural man, it will be perceived as an inferior and unappealing notion.
    <br>
    <br>
    The root of the divine life is faith; the main branches are love to God, charity to man, purity, and humility.
    <br>
    <br>
    Love to God is a delightful and affectionate sense of God’s perfections. It makes the soul resign and sacrifice itself completely to him. It desires above all things to please him, and has its greatest delight in fellowship and communion with him. It is ready to do or suffer anything for his sake or at his pleasure. Though this affection may begin from the favors and mercies of God toward us, as it grows and matures, it transcends these concepts. It becomes rooted in his infinite goodness that is manifested in all the works of creation, and in all that he does.
    <br>
    <br>
    This is that charity I named as the second branch of religion. Under it, all the parts of justice and all the duties we owe to our neighbor are clearly included. He who truly loves the entire world will be equally concerned about the interests of everyone. Such a person will be so far from wronging or injuring anyone, that he will resent anything suffered by another, as if it happened to himself.
    <br>
    <br>
    That sincere and devout affection with which his blessed soul constantly burned toward his Heavenly Father expressed itself in an entire resignation to his will.
<br>
<br>
He endured the harshest afflictions and the most extreme miseries that were ever inflicted on any mortal without feeling rejection or uttering discontentment. He was very aware of what was happening, wasn’t unnaturally indestructible, didn’t lack emotions, felt pain just as other men, and knew exactly what he was to suffer in his soul. This is made perfectly clear by the “bloody sweat, agony, and deep sorrow of soul” he expressed as he faced these things. In spite of all this, he submitted completely to the intense fulfillment of the Father’s will and willingly accepted it.
<br>
<br>
He did this even though he had no sins to confess and few worldly interests to pray for. Sadly, these are the only things that tend to drive us to our devotions.
<br>
<br>
No one departed from him with a heavy countenance, except that youth (Mark 10) who was sorry to hear that entrance to the kingdom of heaven was difficult, in that he could not save his soul and his money too.
<br>
<br>
Should Jesus create a new way to heaven and alter the nature of reality that makes it impossible for a covetous man to be happy?
<br>
<br>
One’s desires and feelings are no longer tied to the inclinations of the physical senses and the influence of external objects. Instead, they are moved by more divine influences and sense the reality of invisible things.
<br>
<br>
He who loves inferior and filthy things becomes base and vile. But a noble and well-placed affection advances and improves the spirit into conformity with the perfections it loves. The characteristics and qualities of the loved objects are regularly on one’s mind. In conjunction with this focus, by an unknown force and energy, the images of the objects loved are woven into the fabric of the soul, molding and fashioning it into their own likenesses.
<br>
<br>
Love is the greatest and most excellent thing we can control. Therefore, giving it to inferior objects is foolishness and self-degradation.
<br>
<br>
...love is truly the most valuable present we can offer to God. Therefore, it is extremely debased when we give it anywhere else.
<br>
<br>
There is no slavery as low as the slavery of a man who becomes a forced laborer to his own lusts. And there is no victory as glorious as the victory over them.
<br>
<br>
I don’t know the thoughts people have concerning humility, but I see almost everyone pretending to have it.
<br>
<br>
The Holy Ghost must come upon us and the power of the Most High must overshadow us before the holy life is birthed and Christ is formed in us. But we must not expect that the complete work will be accomplished without any cooperating effort of our own.
<br>
<br>
There can’t be a treaty of peace with God until we lay down these weapons of rebellion that attack heaven. Nor can we expect to have our corrupted nature cured if we are feeding daily on poison.
<br>
<br>
In order to pursue holiness, we must begin by thoroughly educating ourselves regarding what sins we must abstain from.
<br>
<br>
If we could ever “cleanse our way,” it must be “by taking heed to the word of God.”
<br>
<br>
Then let us never look upon any sin as light and trivial. We are to be fully persuaded that the smallest sin is infinitely heinous in the sight of God and harmful to the souls of men. If we have corrected eyesight, we will be as deeply affected with our smallest irregularities as we are with the worst crimes.
<br>
    <br>
    Because of our individual personalities, habits, and desires in this world, we will find that some of the things that we discover to be sinful have been deeply wedded to our lives. We have become one with these to the extent that our turning from them will seem like cutting off our right hands or plucking out our right eyes.
    <br>
    <br>
    Let us, therefore, make a habit of serious consideration of what a fearful thing it must be to irritate and offend the infinite Being. He is the only one who can keep us from everlasting destruction and the one we depend on every moment. He can make us miserable by simply withdrawing his mercies or make us nothing by withdrawing his assistance.
    <br>
    <br>
    Considering these things from time to time is not enough. Neither is making resolutions about forsaking our sins. We must also maintain a constant guard and be continually watching against them.
    <br>
    <br>
    This care and watchfulness over our actions must be accompanied by the frequent and serious reflection of them.
<br>
<br>
Before we fall asleep at night, we should remember and examine all the events of the day. In this way we may be encouraged by what we have done right, and may correct what we recognize as having missed the mark. We can make the shipwrecks of today into the danger signs to direct our course tomorrow. This may be called the very art of virtuous living. It will make a significant contribution to the advancement of our reformation and the preservation of our innocence. But in the practice of these things, we must not forget to ask God to assist us.
<br>
<br>
Even though our hearts may tell us that we haven’t become the new creations that would make our devotions acceptable to God, these suggestions to help us turn from sin may influence our natural man to become serious about seeking the new birth.
<br>
<br>
Common honesty will make us too ashamed to relapse into the faults we have recently bewailed before God, and have begged him to help us get the victory over.
<br>
<br>
So it is by the restraint of our natural inclinations that we begin our efforts to recover the divine life. Restraint keeps these inclinations from breaking out in sinful practices.
<br>
<br>
But now I must add that Christian wisdom will teach us to abstain from gratifications that are not unlawful in themselves. We do this for more than securing our innocence that would be constantly threatened when we push the limits of our liberty. Through our restraint, we weaken the power of our natural man and teach our appetites to obey.
<br>
<br>
He who desires to mortify the pride and vanity of his spirit should stop his ears to the most deserved praises. He should often restrain himself from seeking his just vindication from the criticisms and slanders of others. This is especially important if they merely reflect on his wisdom and conduct, and not on his purity and innocence.
<br>
<br>
Our next course of action must be to wean our affections from created things, and all the delights and entertainments of this lower life.
<br>
<br>
We can recognize that all the glory, splendor, pleasures, and enjoyments of the world are vanity and nothing. Yet these nothings take up all our thoughts and engross all our affections. They stifle the better inclinations of the soul and lead us into many a sin. It may be that we take this issue seriously sometimes, and choose to ignore them and resolve not to be deluded with them anymore. But these corrections of our course seldom outlive the next temptation. The vanities that we have shut the front door on, sneak in through the back gate.
<br>
<br>
If we could break free from this delusion and come to a real and serious contempt of worldly things, we would make real progress in our relationship with God.
<br>
<br>
The love of the world and the love of God are like the scales of a balance. As the one falls, the other rises. When our natural inclinations run our lives and self is exalted in our soul, our spiritual life lacks conviction and becomes weak. But when earthly objects wither away and lose their beauty, and the soul begins to lose its passion and interest in pursuing them, the seeds of grace take root and the Divine life begins to flourish and prevail.
<br>
<br>
Amidst all our pursuits and plans, let us stop and ask ourselves the right questions. What is the goal of all this? What am I aiming at?
<br>
<br>
What will be different next year that could possibly make any difference in the end results of pursuing the things of this world?
<br>
<br>
After we have begun to restrain our corruptions, natural appetites, and inclinations toward worldly things, we must begin to do the things that have a more immediate tendency to excite and awaken the Divine life.
<br>
<br>
If we cannot acquire the change to our inward character now, let us at least study to regulate our outward behavior.
<br>
<br>
…love for God yet, let us validate our allegiance to that Infinite Majesty anyway. We can do this by attending his service, listening to his Word, speaking reverently of his name, praising his goodness, and exhorting others to serve and obey him.
<br>
<br>
Even though our stubborn hearts should shrink back and rebel, let us tell him we are convinced that his will is always just and good. Therefore, we can tell him that our desire is for him to do whatever he pleases with us regardless of our will.
<br>
<br>
Therefore, we must consciously and diligently apply ourselves to develop a serious belief in and a full persuasion of divine truths. We must do this until we develop a perception of and sensitivity to spiritual things. Our thoughts must dwell upon them until we are both convinced of them and deeply affected by them.
<br>
<br>
When we reflect on who we are, let us consider that we are not merely a piece of organized matter or just some amazing and marvelous organism. We must recognize that there is more to us than flesh, blood, and bones–the divine spark, capable of knowing, loving, and enjoying our Maker.
<br>
<br>
In this world, our souls and spirits are severely hindered by their ignorant and cumbersome physical companion (our flesh). Even so, they will be delivered soon. Then they can exist without the body, like we can without the clothes that we throw off whenever we want. Therefore, let us regularly withdraw our thoughts from this earth, this scene of misery, folly, and sin. Raise them toward the world that is more vast and glorious.
<br>
<br>
And first, to set our souls on fire with the love for God, let us consider the excellence of his nature and his lovingkindness toward us.
<br>
<br>
We don’t know much of the Divine perfections. Even so, the little bit we do know may be sufficient to fill our souls with admiration and love to captivate our affections and to increase our awe of him.
<br>
<br>
“He is not far from every one of us, for in him we live, move, and have our being.” We cannot open our eyes without seeing some traces of his glory. We cannot turn them toward him and not find that he is certainly watching us, waiting for us to look at him, and ready to entertain the most intimate fellowship and communion with us.
<br>
<br>
Therefore, let us endeavor to lift our minds to the clearest comprehension of the Divine nature. Let us consider all that His works declare and all that his Word reveals about him.
<br>
<br>
He is the One who appeared in the world to clearly reveal what God is like, and to be the example of how we should live. Let us bring him clearly before our minds, exactly as we find him described in the Gospels.
<br>
<br>
If we add the consideration of God’s favor and goodwill toward us, the fire within will blaze especially bright. There is nothing more powerful for engaging our affection than finding that we are beloved.
<br>
<br>
The eye of his providence is always upon us, and he watches over our safety when we are in a deep sleep, unaware of him and of ourselves.
<br>
<br>
He has proved his affection for us by suffering, as well as by doing. And he took on our nature because he could not suffer in his own.
<br>
<br>
…recall that one of the poets had an ingenious ability to express the passion that overcame him after a long resistance. He said that the God of love shot all his golden arrows at him, but could never pierce his heart until he finally put himself into the bow and fired himself straight into his heart.
<br>
<br>
We should regularly consider the many tokens of favor and love which God has given to each of us. He has put up with our follies and sins for so long, waited to be gracious to us, wrestled with the stubbornness of our hearts, and tested every method to reclaim us.
<br>
<br>
This is increased as we consider that every soul is dearer to him than the entire material world is, and that he did not believe the blood of his Son was too great a price for their redemption.
<br>
<br>
We must not dream of a Mohammedan paradise, or settle on the metaphors and shadows often used to represent these joys.
<br>
<br>
But when we begin to understand the real meaning of these pure and spiritual pleasures, when the happiness we fix our thoughts on comes from the sight, love, and enjoyment of God, and our minds are filled with the hopes and expectations of that blessed state, oh how low and despicable everything here below will appear in our eyes! Then with disdain we will reject the ignorant and polluted pleasures that would deprive us of the celestial enjoyments now, or make us less prepared for eternity, and diminish our desire for what really matters!
<br>
<br>
All our wickedness, imperfections, follies, and sins may help to pull down that fond and exaggerated conceit we are likely to entertain about ourselves.
<br>
<br>
If the thoughts that pass in our heart during the best and most serious day of our lives were exposed to public view, they would pronounce us to be either malicious or ridiculous.
 <br>
 <br>
But it is well observed by a pious writer, that the deepest and most pure humility doesn’t arise primarily from the consideration of our own faults and defects. It is cultivated by a calm and quiet contemplation of God’s purity and goodness.
<br>
<br>
There is another where, although we utter no sound, yet we conceive the expressions and form the words in our minds.
<br>
<br>
There is a third and more sublime kind of a prayer where the soul takes a higher flight. Having collected all its forces through long and serious meditation, it fires itself like an arrow toward God in sighs, groans, and thoughts too vast for words.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes after sorrowful reflections on its vileness and mistakes, the soul prostrates itself before him with the greatest confusion and sorrow, not daring to lift up its eyes or utter one word in his presence.
<br>
<br>
Let us not trust in our own strength, nor distrust your divine assistance.
<br>
<br>
“Control our hearts with a generous and holy disdain for all the poor enjoyments which this world offers to entice us.
<br>
<br>
“Finally, O God, grant that the contemplation of what you are and of what we are, may each humble and prostrate us before you.
<br>
<br>
We desire to cease striving against and to surrender ourselves to the direction of the Holy Spirit, so lead us in your truth and teach us, for you are the God of our salvation.
