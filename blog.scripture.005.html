<h1 class="center">To Whom Shall I Speak?</h1>
<p class="center">
 
Be forewarned, O Jerusalem, or I will turn away from you; I will make you a desolation,
 a land without inhabitant.” This is what the LORD of Hosts says: “Glean the remnant of
  Israel as thoroughly as a vine. Pass your hand once more like a grape gatherer over the 
  branches.”
  <br>
Jeremiah 6:8-9
<br>
<br>
I have forsaken My house; I have abandoned My inheritance. I have given the love of My life
 into the hands of her enemies. My inheritance has become to Me like a lion in the forest.
  She has roared against Me; therefore I hate her. Is not My inheritance to Me like a 
  speckled bird of prey with other birds of prey circling against her? Go, gather all the
   beasts of the field; bring them to devour her. Many shepherds have destroyed My vineyard;
    they have trampled My plot of ground. They have turned My pleasant field into a desolate
     wasteland. They have made it a desolation; desolate before Me, it mourns. All the land
      is laid waste, but no man takes it to heart.
      <br>
Jeremiah 12:7-11
<br>
<br>
To whom can I give this warning? Who will listen to me? Look, their ears are closed, so they
 cannot hear. See, the word of the LORD has become offensive to them; they find no pleasure
  in it. 
  <br>
Jeremiah 6:10
<br>
<br>
“And I will make Jerusalem a heap of rubble, a haunt for jackals; and I will make the
 cities of Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.” Who is the man wise enough to 
 understand this? To whom has the mouth of the LORD spoken, that he may explain it? Why
  is the land destroyed and scorched like a desert, so no one can pass through it? And
   the LORD answered, “It is because they have forsaken My law, which I set before them;
    they have not walked in it or obeyed My voice. Instead, they have followed the
     stubbornness of their hearts and gone after the Baals, as their fathers taught
      them.” 
      <br>
Jeremiah 9:11-14
<br>
<br>
What jumps out is that God couldn't get through to anybody. Nobody was hearing from Him,
nobody knew what God was doing. Rather than taking pleasure in the message and responding 
to it, they took offense. In a time when everybody is too busy to hear from God, too 
distracted to focus on etenrity, too confused to be confident, we desparately need to
 be hearing from God and have a word from Him. We need to be able to get up, open the 
 Bible and it begins to speak to us, God begins to show us things. Open my eyes that I
  may see wonderous things in Your Law! Can He give warning to you? Can He speak to you?
   Can you hear what He has to say? Can you explain why the world system is collapsing?
    In the midst of the mass majoirty having to answer 'no' to these kinds of questions,
     God found a man who could answer 'yes' Many times we see the mass majoirty fallen 
     away, and God having a man who sees, a man He uses. 
     <br>
     <br>
Therefore this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: “Behold, I will feed
 this people wormwood and give them poisoned water to drink. I will scatter them among 
 the nations that neither they nor their fathers have known, and I will send a sword after
  them until I have finished them off.”
  <br>
Jeremiah 9:15-16
<br>
<br>
Then the third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star burning like a torch fell
 from heaven and landed on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water. The name
  of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters turned bitter like wormwood oil, and 
  many people died from the bitter waters.
  <br>
Revelation 8:10-11
<br>
<br>
Though the lips of the forbidden woman drip honey and her speech is smoother than oil,
 in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a double-edged sword.
 <br>
Proverbs 5:3-4
<br>
<br>
For this is what the LORD says to the house of Israel: “Seek Me and live! Do not seek
 Bethel or go to Gilgal; do not journey to Beersheba, for Gilgal will surely go into 
 exile, and Bethel will come to nothing. Seek the LORD and live, or He will sweep like
  fire through the house of Joseph; it will devour everything, with no one at Bethel 
  to extinguish it. There are those who turn justice into wormwood and cast righteousness
   to the ground.
   <br>
Amos 5:4-7
<br>
<br>
“Do horses gallop on the cliffs? Does one plow the sea with oxen? But you have turned 
justice into poison and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood— you who rejoice in 
Lo-debar and say, ‘Did we not take Karnaim by our own strength?’
<br>
Amos 6:12-13
<br>
<br>
Therefore this is what the LORD of Hosts says concerning the prophets: “I will feed them 
wormwood and give them poisoned water to drink, for from the prophets of Jerusalem
 ungodliness has spread throughout the land.” This is what the LORD of Hosts says: “Do
  not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you. They are filling you with
   false hopes. They speak visions from their own minds, not from the mouth of the LORD.
    They keep saying to those who despise Me, ‘The LORD says that you will have peace,’ 
    and to everyone who walks in the stubbornness of his own heart, ‘No harm will come 
    to you.’ But which of them has stood in the council of the LORD to see and hear His
     word? Who has given heed to His word and obeyed it? Behold, the storm of the LORD
      has gone out with fury, a whirlwind swirling down upon the heads of the wicked. 
      The anger of the LORD will not turn back until He has fully accomplished the
       purposes of His heart. In the days to come you will understand this clearly.
       <br>
Jeremiah 23:15-20
<br>
<br>
Make sure there is no man or woman, clan or tribe among you today whose heart turns 
away from the LORD our God to go and worship the gods of those nations. Make sure there
 is no root among you that bears such poisonous and bitter fruit, because when such a 
 person hears the words of this oath, he invokes a blessing on himself, saying, ‘I will
  have peace, even though I walk in the stubbornness of my own heart.’ This will bring
   disaster on the watered land as well as the dry. The LORD will never be willing to
    forgive him. Instead, His anger and jealousy will burn against that man, and every
     curse written in this book will fall upon him. The LORD will blot out his name
      from under heaven and single him out from all the tribes of Israel for disaster,
       according to all the curses of the covenant written in this Book of the Law.
        Then the generation to come—your sons who follow you and the foreigner who 
        comes from a distant land—will see the plagues of the land and the sicknesses
         the LORD has inflicted on it. All its soil will be a burning waste of
          sulfur and salt, unsown and unproductive, with no plant growing on it,
           just like the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim,
            which the LORD overthrew in His fierce anger. So all the nations will
             ask, ‘Why has the LORD done such a thing to this land? Why this great 
             outburst of anger?’ And the people will answer, ‘It is because they
              abandoned the covenant of the LORD, the God of their fathers, which 
              He made with them when He brought them out of the land of Egypt. They
               went and served other gods, and they worshiped gods they had not 
               known—gods that the LORD had not given to them. Therefore the anger
                of the LORD burned against this land, and He brought upon it every
                 curse written in this book. The LORD uprooted them from their land 
                 in His anger, rage, and great wrath, and He cast them into another
                  land, where they are today.’ The secret things belong to the LORD 
                  our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our children
                   forever, so that we may follow all the words of this law.
                   <br>
Deuteronomy 29:18-20
<br>
<br>
To whom can I give this warning? Who will listen to me? Look, their ears are closed,
 so they cannot hear. See, the word of the LORD has become offensive to them; they
  find no pleasure in it. But I am full of the LORD’s wrath; I am tired of holding
   it back. “Pour it out on the children in the street, and on the young men gathered
    together. For both husband and wife will be captured, the old and the very old alike.
     Their houses will be turned over to others, their fields and wives as well, for I
      will stretch out My hand against the inhabitants of the land,” declares the LORD.
       “For from the least of them to the greatest, all are greedy for gain; from 
       prophet to priest, all practice deceit. They dress the wound of My people with
        very little care, saying, ‘Peace, peace,’ when there is no peace at all. Are
         they ashamed of the abomination they have committed? No, they have no shame
          at all; they do not even know how to blush. So they will fall among the fallen;
           when I punish them, they will collapse,” says the LORD. This is what the LORD
            says: “Stand at the crossroads and look. Ask for the ancient paths: ‘Where 
            is the good way?’ Then walk in it, and you will find rest for your souls.
             But they said, ‘We will not walk in it!’ I appointed watchmen over you
              and said, ‘Listen for the sound of the ram’s horn.’ But they answered,
               ‘We will not listen!’ Therefore hear, O nations, and learn, O congregations,
                what will happen to them. Hear, O earth! I am bringing disaster on this
                 people, the fruit of their own schemes, because they have paid no 
                 attention to My word and have rejected My instruction.
                 <br>
Jeremiah 6:10-19
<br>
<br>
We have heard the report; our hands hang limp. Anguish has gripped us, pain like that
 of a woman in labor. Do not go out to the fields; do not walk the road. For the enemy
  has a sword; terror is on every side. O daughter of my people, dress yourselves in 
  sackcloth and roll in ashes. Mourn with bitter wailing, as you would for an only son,
   for suddenly the destroyer will come upon us. I have appointed you to examine My
    people like ore, so you may know and try their ways. All are hardened rebels,
     walking around as slanderers. They are bronze and iron; all of them are corrupt.
      The bellows blow fiercely, blasting away the lead with fire.The refining proceeds
       in vain, for the wicked are not purged. They are called rejected silver, because
        the LORD has rejected them.”
        <br>
Jeremiah 6:24-30
<br>
<br>
Go now, write it on a tablet in their presence and inscribe it on a scroll; it will
 be for the days to come, a witness forever and ever. These are rebellious people,
  deceitful children, children unwilling to obey the LORD’s instruction. They say 
  to the seers, “Stop seeing visions!” and to the prophets, “Do not prophesy to us
   the truth! Speak to us pleasant words; prophesy illusions. Get out of the way; 
   turn off the road. Rid us of the Holy One of Israel!” Therefore this is what the
    Holy One of Israel says: “Because you have rejected this message, trusting in 
    oppression and relying on deceit, this iniquity of yours is like a breach about
     to fail, a bulge in a high wall, whose collapse will come suddenly— in an 
     instant! It will break in pieces like a potter’s jar, shattered so that no 
     fragment can be found. Not a shard will be found in the dust large enough 
     to scoop the coals from a hearth or to skim the water from a cistern.” For
      the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel, has said: “By repentance and rest 
      you would be saved; your strength would lie in quiet confidence— but you
       were not willing.” No,” you say, “we will flee on horses.” Therefore 
       you will flee! “We will ride swift horses,” but your pursuers will be 
       faster. A thousand will flee at the threat of one; at the threat of
        five you will all flee, until you are left alone like a pole on a
         mountaintop, like a banner on a hill. Therefore the LORD longs to
          be gracious to you; therefore He rises to show you compassion,
           for the LORD is a just God. Blessed are all who wait for Him.
            O people in Zion who dwell in Jerusalem, you will weep no more.
             He will surely be gracious when you cry for help; when He hears, 
             He will answer you. The Lord will give you the bread of adversity 
             and the water of affliction, but your Teacher will no longer
              hide Himself—with your own eyes you will see Him. And whether you 
              turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear this command
               behind you: “This is the way. Walk in it.” So you will desecrate
                your silver-plated idols and your gold-plated images. You will 
                throw them away like menstrual cloths, saying to them, “Be gone!”
                <br>
