    <p class="center">
        And can it be that I should gain
        <br>
        An int'rest in the Savior's blood?
        <br>
        Died He for me, who caused His pain?
        <br>
        For me, who Him to death pursued?
        <br>
        Amazing love! how can it be
        <br>
        That Thou, my God, should die for me?
        <br>
        <br>
        Refrain:
        <br>
Amazing love! how can it be
<br>
That Thou, my God, should die for me!
<br>
<br>
'Tis mystery all! Th'Immortal dies!
<br>
Who can explore His strange design?
<br>
In vain the firstborn seraph tries
<br>
To sound the depths of love divine!
<br>
'Tis mercy all! let earth adore,
<br>
Let angel minds inquire no more. [Refrain]
<br>
<br>
He left His Father's throne above,
<br>
So free, so infinite His grace;
<br>
Emptied Himself of all but love,
<br>
And bled for Adam's helpless race;
<br>
'Tis mercy all, immense and free;
<br>
For, O my God, it found out me. [Refrain]
<br>
<br>
Long my imprisoned spirit lay
<br>
Fast bound in sin and nature's night;
<br>
Thine eye diffused a quick'ning ray,
<br>
I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;
<br>
My chains fell off, my heart was free;
<br>
I rose, went forth and followed Thee. [Refrain]
<br>
<br>
No condemnation now I dread;
<br>
Jesus, and all in Him is mine!
<br>
Alive in Him, my living Head,
<br>
And clothed in righteousness divine,
<br>
Bold I approach th'eternal throne,
<br>
And claim the crown, through Christ my own. [Refrain]
