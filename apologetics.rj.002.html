        <h1>No blood No atonement</h1>
   <p class="center">
    For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you to make atonement for your souls upon the altar; for it is the blood that makes atonement for the soul. 
    <br>
    Leviticus 17:11
    <br>
    <br>
    Indeed, according to the law nearly everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no remission. 
    <br>
    Hebrews 9:22
    <br>
    <br>
    There is no forgiveness without the shedding of blood. The Torah states that the blood is given to make atonement. The sacrificial system became impossible in 70AD with the destruction of the temple. Why did God allow this to happen if the only way of remission is through blood? What blood has been available to atone for sins for almost 2000 years? An objection to this is that when Jonah preached the people repented, and were forgiven without blood. But this doesn’t deal with Leviticus, it makes the matter worse because there are now two discrepancies. The answer to the question is that the suffering servant is about a man. This man had to come before 70AD in order for there to be remission through blood. Messiah was prophesied to be killed in Daniel. Isaiah agrees with this in saying the suffering servant was cut off from the land of the living. The reason that the people of Nineveh could be forgiven is revealed in Romans 3:21-26. God could look to the cross and the blood atonement which would occur in the future. This is why blood sacrifices were accepted. It is not that the animals themselves were capable of taking away sins, and the guilt of sins. But they pointed to the one to come, and God could look into the future and see the one to come, accepting the blood sacrifices of bulls and goats. God could Passover His people when He saw the blood of a lamb. It was not because of how much He likes Lamb blood, but He could look into the future and see what this pointed to. However, if this is not the case then it must be explained how God has been forgiving sins for almost 2000 years without blood, and how He forgave other people when they repented without shedding blood.

    Surely He took on our infirmities and carried our sorrows; yet we considered Him stricken by God, struck down and afflicted. But He was pierced for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed. We all like sheep have gone astray, each one has turned to his own way; and the LORD has laid upon Him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed and afflicted, yet He did not open His mouth. He was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is silent, so He did not open His mouth. By oppression and judgment He was taken away, and who can recount His descendants? For He was cut off from the land of the living; He was stricken for the transgression of My people. He was assigned a grave with the wicked, and with a rich man in His death, although He had done no violence, nor was any deceit in His mouth. Yet it was the LORD’s will to crush Him and to cause Him to suffer; and when His soul is made a guilt offering, He will see His offspring, He will prolong His days, and the good pleasure of the LORD will prosper in His hand. 
    <br>
    Isaiah 53:4-10
    <br>
    <br>
     Then after the sixty-two weeks the Messiah will be cut off and will have nothing. Then the people of the prince who is to come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end will come like a flood, and until the end there will be war; desolations have been decreed. 
    <br>
    Daniel 9:26
    <br>
    <br>
    But now the righteousness of God has been revealed apart from the law, attested by the Law and the Prophets, that is, the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all and upon all who believe; for there is no distinction. For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, being freely justified by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith, by his blood. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over the sins that had previously been committed. He did so to prove in the present time that he is righteous and that he justifies the one who has faith in Jesus.
