<p class="center">
In time of temptation, apprehensive consciences look so much to the present trouble they are in that they need to be roused up to behold him in whom they may find rest for their distressed souls. In temptations it is safest to behold nothing but Christ the true brazen serpent, the true 'Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world'"
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 1
<br>
<br>
Gods people are bruised reeds before their conversion and oftentimes after. Before conversion (except such as, being brought up in the church, God delighted to show himself gracious to from their childhood) are bruised reeds, yet in different degrees, as God sees fit. And as there are differences with regard to temperment, gifts and manner of life, so there are in Gods intention to use men in time to come; for usually he empties such of themselves, and makes them nothing, before he will use them in any great services.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 1
<br>
<br>
The bruised reed is a man that for the most part is in some misery, as those were that came to Christ for help, any by misery he is brought to see sin as the cause of it, for, whatever pretences sin makes, they come to an end when we are bruised and broken
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 1
<br>
<br>
This bruising is required before conversion that so the Spirit may make way for himself into the heart by levelling all proud, high thoughts, and that we may understand ourselves to be what indeed we are by nature. We love to wander from ourselves and to be strangers at home, till God bruises us by one cross or other and then we 'begin to think' and come home to ourselves with the prodigal
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 1
<br>
<br>
After conversion we need bruising so that reeds may know themselves to be reeds, and not oaks. Even reeds need bruising, by reason of the remainder of pride in our nature, and to let us see that we live by mercy. Such bruising may help weaker Christians not be too much discourages, when they see stronger ones shaken and bruised. Thus, Peter was bruised when he wept bitterly (Matt. 26:75). 
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 1
<br>
<br>
Physicians, though they put their patients to much pain, will not destroy nature, but raise it up by degrees. Surgeons will lance and cut, but not dismember. A mother who has a sick and self willed child will not therefore cast it away. And shall there be more mercy in the stream than in the spring? Shall we think there is more mercy in ourselves than in God, who plants the affection of mercy in us?
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 2
<br>
<br>
He never turned any back that came to him, though some went away of themselves
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 2
He shed tears for those who shed his blood, and now he makes intercession in heaven for weak Christians, standing between them and Gods anger
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 2
<br>
<br>
What should we learn from this but to 'come boldly to the throne of grace' (Heb 4:16) in all our grievances? Shall our sins discourage us when he appears there only for sinners? Are you bruised? Be of good comfort, he calls you. Conceal not your wounds, open all before him and take not Satans counsel. Go to Christ, although trembling, as the poor woman who said 'If I may but touch his garment' (Matt 9:21)
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 2
<br>
<br>
Christs way is first to wound, then to heal
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 2
<br>
<br>
But if we have this for a foundation truth, that there is more mercy in Christ than sin in us, there can be no danger in thorough dealing. It is better to go bruised to heaven than sound to hell. Therefore let us not take of ourselves too soon, nor pull off the plaster before the cure be wrought, but keep ourselves under this work till sin be the sourest, and Christ be the sweatest, of all things. And when Gods hand is on us in any way, it is good to divert our sorrow for other things to the root of all, which is sin
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 2
<br>
<br>
Let all know that none are fitter for comfort than those that think themselves furthest off.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 2
<br>
<br>
So we see that grace does not do away with corruption all at once, but some is left for believers to fight with. The purest actions of the purest men need Christ to perfume them; and this is his office. When we pray, we need to pray again for Christ to pardon the defects of our prayers
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 3
<br>
<br>
Broken hearts can yield but broken prayers
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 3
<br>
<br>
From this mixture arises the fact that the people of God have so different judgements of themselves, looking sometimes at the work of grace, sometimes at the remainder of corruption, and when they look upon that, then they think they have no grace. Though they love Christ in his ordinances and children, yet they dare not claim so near acquaintance as to be his. Even as a candle in the socket sometimes shows its light, and sometimes the show of light is lost; so sometimmes they are well persuaded of themselves, sometimes at a loss
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 3
<br>
<br>
He quenched not that little light in Peter, which was smothered: peter denied him, but he denied not Peter
<br>

<br>
<br>
Is it not the best way, to assail young beginners with minor matters, but to show them a more excellent way and train them in fundemental points
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 4
<br>
<br>
It would be a good contest among Christians, one to labour to give no offence, and the other to labour to take none. The best men are severe to themselves, tender over others. Yet people should not tire and wear out the patience of others: nor should the weaker so far demand moderation from others as to rely upon their indulgence and so to rest in their own infirmities, with danger to their own souls and scandal to the church
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 4
<br>
<br>
Christ refuses none for weakness of parts, that none should be discouraged, but accepts none for greatness, that none should be lifted up with that which is of so little reckoing with God. It is no great matter how dull the scholar be when Christ takes upon him to be the teacher, who, as he prescribes what to understand, so he gives understanding itself, even to the simplest
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 4
<br>
<br>
There is therefore in these judging times good ground of James's caveat that there should not be 'many masters' (James 3:1), that we should not smite one another by hasty censures, especially in things of an indifferent nature
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 5
<br>
<br>
We must supply out of our love and mercy that which we see wanting in them. The church of Christ is a common hospital, wherein all are in some measure sick of some spiritual disease or other, so all have occasion to excercise the spirit of wisdom and meekness
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 5
<br>
<br>
The prodigal would not say he was no son, but that he was not worthy to be called a son (Luke 15: 19).
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 6
<br>
<br>
Some have light of knowledge, yet follow not that light, but are guided by carnal reason and policy, such as those the prophet speaks of, ` All ye that kindle a fire . . . walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow' (Isa. 50: 11). God delights to confound carnal wisdom, as enmity to him, and robbing him of his prerogative, who is God only wise. We must, therefore, walk by his light, not the blaze of our own fire.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 6
<br>
<br>
The light which some men have is like lightning which, after a sudden flash, leaves them more in darkness. They can love the light as it shines, but hate it as it discovers and directs. A little holy light will enable us to keep Christ's Word, and not betray religion nor deny his name, as Christ speaks of the church of Philadelphia (Rev. 3: 8).
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 6
<br>
<br>
Therefore, those that plead and plot for liberties for the flesh show themselves strangers from the life of God. Feeling this strife, gracious men often complain that they have no grace. But they contradict themselves in their complaints, as if a man that sees should complain he cannot see, or complain that he is asleep; whereas the very complaint, springing from a displeasure against sin, shows that there is something in him opposite to sin. Can a dead man complain? Some things, though bad in themselves, yet reveal good, as smoke reveals the presence of fire.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 6
<br>
<br>
Therefore his temptations fasten, for the most part, some taint upon us. And if there were no devil to suggest, yet sinful thoughts would arise from within us, though none were cast in from without. We have a mint of them within. These thoughts, if the soul dwell on them so long as to suck or draw from and by them any sinful delight, then they leave a more heavy guilt upon the soul, hinder our sweet communion with God, interrupt our peace, and put a contrary relish into the soul, disposing it to greater sins. All scandalous actions are only thoughts at the first. Ill thoughts are as little thieves, which, creeping in at the window, open the door to greater. Thoughts are seeds of actions. These, especially when they are helped forward by Satan, make the life of many good Christians almost a martyrdom. In this case it is an unsound comfort that some minister, that ill thoughts arise from nature, and what is natural is excusable. We must know that nature, as it came out of God's hands in the beginning, had no such risings out of it. The soul, as inspired of God, had no such unsavory breathings. But since it betrayed itself by sin it is, in some sort, natural to it to forge sinful imaginations, and to be a furnace of such sparks. And this is an aggravation of the sinfulness of natural corruption, that it is so deeply rooted and so generally spread in our nature.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 7
<br>
<br>
Nothing more abases the spirits of holy men that desire to delight in God after they have escaped the common defilements of the world than these unclean issues of spirit, as being most contrary to God, who is a pure Spirit.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 7
<br>
<br>
A Christian complains he cannot pray. ` Oh, I am troubled with so many distracting thoughts, and never more than now!' But has he put into your heart a desire to pray? Then he will hear the desires of his own Spirit in you. ` We know not what we should pray for as we ought' (nor how to do anything else as we ought), but the Spirit helps our infirmities with ` groanings which cannot be uttered' (Rom. 8: 26), which are not hid from God. ` My groaning is not hid from thee' (Psa. 38: 9). God can pick sense out of a confused prayer. These desires cry louder in his ears than your sins. Sometimes a Christian has such confused thoughts that he can say nothing but, as a child, cries, ` O Father', not able to express what he needs, like Moses at the Red Sea. These stirrings of spirit touch the heart of God and melt him into compassion towards us, when they come from the Spirit of adoption, and from a striving to be better.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 7
<br>
<br>
There is never a holy sigh, never a tear we shed, which is lost. And as every grace increases by exercise of itself, so does the grace of prayer. By prayer we learn to pray. So, likewise, we should take heed of a spirit of discouragement in all other holy duties, since we have so gracious a Saviour. Pray as we are able, hear as we are able, strive as we are able, do as we are able, according to the measure of grace received. God in Christ will cast a gracious eye upon that which is his own. Would Paul do nothing because he could not do the good that he would? No, he ` pressed toward the mark'.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 7
<br>
<br>
But when, with faithful endeavor, we come short of what we would be, and short of what others are, then know for our comfort, Christ will not quench the smoking flax, and that sincerity and truth, as we said before, with endeavor of growth, is our perfection. 
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 7
<br>
<br>
‘Lord, I believe' (Mark 9: 24), with a weak faith, yet with faith; love thee with a faint love, yet with love; endeavor in a feeble manner, yet endeavor. A little fire is fire, though it smokes. Since thou hast taken me into thy covenant to be thine from being an enemy, wilt thou cast me off for these infirmities, which, as they displease thee, so are they the grief of my own heart?
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 7
<br>
<br>
In and after duty we find that experience of God's presence which, without obedience, we may long wait for, and yet go without. This does not hinder the Spirit's freedom in blowing upon our souls when he pleases (John 3: 8), for we speak only of such a state of soul as is becalmed and must row, as it were, against the stream. As in sailing the hand must be to the helm and the eye to the star, so here we must put forth that little strength we have to duty and look up for assistance, which the Spirit, as freely as seasonably, will afford.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 8
<br>
<br>
Suffering brings discouragements, because of our impatience. ` Alas!', we lament, ` I shall never get through such a trial.' But if God brings us into the trial he will be with us in the trial, and at length bring us out, more refined. We shall lose nothing but dross (Zech. 13: 9). From our own strength we cannot bear the least trouble, but by the Spirit's assistance we can bear the greatest. The Spirit will add his shoulders to help us to bear our infirmities. The Lord will give his hand to heave us up (Psa. 37: 24). 'Ye have heard of the patience of job,' says James (James 5: 11). We have heard of his impatience too, but it pleased God mercifully to overlook that. It yields us comfort also in desolate conditions, such as contagious sicknesses and the like, in which we are more immediately under God's hand, that then Christ has a throne of mercy at our bedside and numbers our tears and our groans.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 8
<br>
<br>
The husband is bound to bear with the wife, as being the ` weaker vessel' (1 Pet. 3: 7), and shall we think Christ will exempt himself from his own rule, and not bear with his weak spouse?
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 8
<br>
<br>
If Christ should not be merciful to our weaknesses, he should not have a people to serve him.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 8
<br>
<br>
But lest we flatter ourselves without good grounds, we must know that weaknesses are to be reckoned either imperfections cleaving to our best actions, or actions proceeding from immaturity in Christ, whilst we are babes, or the effects of want of strength, where ability is small, or sudden unintended breakings out, contrary to our general bent and purpose, whilst our judgment is overcast with the cloud of a sudden temptation, after which we feel our infirmity, grieve for it and from grief, complain, and, with complaining, strive and labour to reform; finally, in laboring, we make some progress against our corruption.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 8
<br>
<br>
But to plead for an infirmity is more than an infirmity; to allow ourselves in weaknesses is more than a weakness. The justification of evil shuts our mouths, so that the soul cannot call God Father with childlike liberty, or enjoy sweet communion with him, until peace be made by shaming ourselves, and renewing our faith.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 8
<br>
<br>
Though a godly man may suddenly be drawn or driven aside in some particulars, yet, by reason of that interest the Spirit of Christ has in him, and because his aims are right in the main, he will either recover of himself, or yield to the counsel of others.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 8
<br>
<br>
There must be a right judgment, allowing of the best ways, or else the heart is rotten. Then it will infuse corruption into the whole conversation, so that all men's actions become infected at the spring head. They then justify looseness and condemn God's ways as too much strictness. Their principles whereby they work are not good.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 8
<br>
<br>
To the extent that we give way to our will in sinning, to that extent we set ourselves at a distance from comfort. Sin against conscience is as a thief2 in the candle, which spoils our joy, and thereby weakens our strength. We must know, therefore, that willful breaches in sanctification will much hinder the sense of our justification. What course shall such take to recover their peace? They must condemn themselves sharply, and yet cast themselves upon God's mercy in Christ, as at their first conversion. And now they must embrace Christ the more firmly, as they see more need in themselves; and let them remember the mildness of Christ here, that he will not quench the smoking flax. Often we see that, after a deep humiliation, Christ speaks more peace than before, to witness the truth of this reconciliation, because he knows Satan's enterprises in casting such down lower, because they are most abased in themselves and are ashamed to look Christ in the face, because of their ingratitude.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 8
<br>
<br>
Christ was not anointed to this great work of Mediator for lesser sins only, but for the greatest, if we have but a spark of true faith to lay hold on him. Therefore, if there be any bruised reed, let him not make an exception of himself, when Christ does not make an exception of him. ` Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden' (Matt. 11: 28). Why should we not make use of so gracious a disposition? We are only poor for this reason, that we do not know our riches in Christ. In time of temptation, believe Christ rather than the devil. Believe truth from truth itself. Hearken not to a liar, an enemy and a murderer.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 8
<br>
<br>
Since Christ is thus comfortably set out to us, let us not believe Satan's representations of him. When we are troubled in conscience for our sins, Satan's manner is then to present Christ to the afflicted soul as a most severe judge armed with justice against us. But then let us present him to our souls as offered to our view by God himself, holding out a scepter of mercy, and spreading his arms to receive us.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 9
<br>
<br>
If you are not so much as smoking flax, then why do you not renounce your interest in Christ, and disclaim the covenant of grace? This you dare not do. Why do you not give yourself up wholly to other pleasures? This your spirit will not allow you to do.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 9
<br>
<br>
Cast yourself into the arms of Christ, and if you perish, perish there. If you do not, you are sure to perish. If mercy is to be found anywhere, it is there.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 9
<br>
<br>
There are those who take it on themselves to cast water on those sparks which Christ labors to kindle in them, because they will not be troubled with the light of them. Such must know that the Lamb can be angry, and that they who will not come under his scepter of mercy shall be crushed in pieces by his scepter of power (Psa. 2: 9).
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 10
<br>
<br>
Though he will graciously tend and maintain the least spark of true grace, yet where he finds not the spark of grace but opposition to his Spirit striving with them, his wrath, once kindled, shall burn to hell. There is no more just provocation than when kindness is churlishly refused.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 10
<br>
<br>
Salvation itself will not save those that spill the medicine and cast away the plaster.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 10
<br>
<br>
Oh, say the rebels of the time, God has not made us to damn us. Yes, if you will not meet Christ in the ways of his mercy, it is fitting that you should ` eat of the fruit of your own way, and be filled with your own devices' (Prow. 1: 31). This will be the hell of hell, when men shall think that they have loved their sins more than their souls; when they shall think what love and mercy has been enforced upon them, and yet they would perish.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 10
<br>
<br>
If men appeal to their own consciences, they will tell them that the Holy Spirit has often knocked at their hearts, as willing to have kindled some holy desires in them. How else can they be said to resist the Holy Ghost, but that the Spirit was readier to draw them to a further degree of goodness than was consistent with their own wills? Therefore those in the church that are damned are self condemned before.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 10
<br>
<br>
Secondly, much more communion with God in holy duties, such as meditation and prayer, which not only kindles but adds a luster to the soul.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 10
<br>
<br>
Nathan, by a few words, blew up the decaying sparks in David. Rather than that God will suffer his fire in us to die, he will send some Nathan or other, and something always is left in us to join with the Word, as of the same nature with it; as a coal that has fire in it will quickly gather more fire to it.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 10
<br>
<br>
Stir up the grace that is in you, for in this way holy motions turn to resolutions, resolutions to practice, and practice to a prepared readiness to every good work.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 10
<br>
<br>
As we look, therefore, for the comfort of this doctrine, let us not favor our natural sloth but exercise ourselves rather to godliness (1 Tim. 4: 7), and labour to keep this fire always burning upon the altar of our hearts. Let us dress our lamps daily, and put in fresh oil, and wind up our souls higher and higher still. Resting in a good condition is contrary to grace, which cannot but promote itself to a further measure. Let none turn this grace ` into lasciviousness' (Jude 4).
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 10
<br>
<br>
Infirmities are a ground of humility, not a plea for negligence, nor an encouragement to presumption.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 10
<br>
<br>
The comfort intended in this text is for those that would fain do better, but find their corruptions clog them; that are in such a mist, that often they cannot tell what to think of themselves; that fain would believe, and yet often fear that they do not believe; and that think that it cannot be that God should be so good to such sinful wretches as they are, and yet they do not permit these fears and doubts in themselves.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 10
<br>
<br>
What need do we have to knock at any other door? Can any be more tender over us than Christ? What encouragement we have to commend the state of the church in general, or of any broken hearted Christian, to him by our prayers, of whom we may speak to Christ, as they did of Lazarus, ` Lord, the church which thou lovest, and gavest thyself for, is in distress'; ` Lord, this poor Christian, for whom thou wast bruised (Isa. 53: 5) is bruised and brought very low.' It cannot but touch his heart when the misery of those so dear to him is spread before him.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 10
<br>
<br>
The apostle could not find out a more heart breaking argument to enforce a sacrifice of ourselves to God than to appeal to us ` by the mercies of God' in Christ (Rom. 12: 1).
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 10
<br>
<br>
One word spoken in season will do more good than a thousand out of season.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 10
<br>
<br>
This may serve for a trial to discern who may lay just claim to Christ's mercy. Only those that will take his yoke and count it a greater happiness to be under his government than to enjoy any liberty of the flesh; that will take whole Christ, and not single out of him what may stand with their present contentment; that will not divide Lord from Jesus, and so make a Christ of their own, may make this claim. None ever did truly desire mercy for pardon but desired mercy for healing. David prays for a new spirit, as well as for a sense of pardoning mercy (Psa. 51: 10).
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 11
<br>
<br>
In the course of our life, after we are in a state of grace, if we are overtaken with any sin, we must remember to have recourse first to Christ's mercy to pardon us, and then to the promise of his Spirit to govern us. 3.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 11
<br>
<br>
And when we feel ourselves cold in affection and duty, the best way is to warm ourselves at this fire of his love and mercy in giving himself for us.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 11
<br>
<br>
The constraint that he lays upon his subjects is that of love. He draws us sweetly with the cords of love. Yet remember also that he draws us strongly by a Spirit of power, for it is not sufficient that we have motives and encouragements to love and obey Christ from that love of his, whereby he gave himself for us to justify us; but Christ's Spirit must likewise subdue our hearts, and sanctify them to love him, without which all motives would be ineffectual.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 11
<br>
<br>
They seek for heaven in hell that seek for spiritual love in an unchanged heart.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 11
<br>
<br>
First we are made partakers of the divine nature, and then we are easily induced and led by Christ's Spirit to spiritual duties.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 11
<br>
<br>
Truth is truth, and error, error, and that which is unlawful is unlawful, whether men think so or not.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 12
<br>
<br>
And, therefore Christ brings about all that is good in the soul through judgment, and that so sweetly that many, by a dangerous error, think that that good which is in them and issues from them is from themselves, and not from the powerful work of grace.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 12
<br>
<br>
The whole soul is out of joint till it be set right again by him whose office is to ` restore all things'.

Secondly, this victory is by degrees, and therefore they are too hasty spirited that would conquer as soon as they strike the first stroke, and be at the end of their race at the first setting forth.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 13
<br>
<br>
Weakness with watchfulness will stand, when strength with too much confidence fails. Weakness, with acknowledgement of it, is the fittest seat and subject for God to perfect his strength in; for consciousness of our infirmities drives us out of ourselves to him in whom our strength lies.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 13
<br>
<br>
Grace conquers us first, and we, by it, conquer all else; whether corruptions within us, or temptations from outside us.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 13
<br>
<br>
We should judge of things as to whether they help or hinder our main purpose; whether they further or hinder our judgment; whether they make us more or less spiritual, and so bring us nearer to the fountain of goodness, God himself; whether they will bring us peace or sorrow at the last; whether they commend us more or less to God, and whether they are the thing in which we shall approve ourselves to him most.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 14
<br>
<br>
He that is begotten of God keepeth himself' (1 John 5: 18), though not by himself, but by the Lord, in dependence on him, in the use of means.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 14
<br>
<br>
Let us know, therefore, that it is dangerous to look for that from ourselves which we must have from Christ.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 15

<br>
Nothing is stronger than humility, which goes out of itself, or weaker than pride, which rests on its own foundation.
<br>
Richard Sibbes, The Bruised Reed, Chapter 15
<br>

We see how weak the apostles themselves were, till they were endued with strength from above. Peter was blasted with the speech of a damsel (Matt. 20: 69), but after the Spirit of Christ fell upon them, the more they suffered, the more they were encouraged to suffer. Their comforts grew with their troubles. Therefore in all, especially difficult encounters,

Satan knows that nothing can prevail against Christ, or those that rely upon his power. Therefore his study is how to keep us in ourselves, and in the creature. But we must carry this always in our minds, that that which is begun in self confidence ends in shame.

Hence it is that we often fail in lesser conflicts and stand firm in greater, because in the lesser we rest more in ourselves, in the greater we fly to the rock of our salvation, which is higher than we (Psa. 61: 2).

God will not trust us with our own salvation, but it is both purchased and kept by Christ for us, and we for it through faith, wrought by the power of God, which we lay hold of.

But God's people feel a powerful work of the Spirit, not only revealing to us our misery and deliverance through Christ, but emptying us of ourselves, as being redeemed from ourselves, and infusing new life into us, and afterwards strengthening us and quickening us when we droop and hang the wing, never leaving us till the conquest is perfect.

But Christ will be no underling to any base affection, and therefore, where there is allowance of ourselves in any sinful lust, it is a sign the keys were never given up to Christ to rule us.

Thus the desperate madness of men is laid open, that they would rather be under the guidance of their own lusts, and in consequence of Satan himself, to their endless destruction, than put their feet into Christ's fetters and their necks under his yoke; though, indeed, Christ's service is the only true liberty.

The victory lies not with us, but with Christ, who has taken on him both to conquer for us and to conquer in us.

Let us not look so much at who our enemies are as at who our judge and captain is, nor at what they threaten, but at what he promises. We have more for us than against us. What coward would not fight when he is sure of victory? None is here overcome but he that will not fight.

Christ will not leave us till he has made us like himself, all glorious within and without, and presented us blameless before his Father (Jude 24).

Satan will object, ` You are a great sinner.' We may answer, ` Christ is a strong Saviour.' But he will object, ` You have no faith, no love.' ` Yes, a spark of faith and love.' ` But Christ will not regard that.' ` Yes, he will not quench the smoking flax: ` But this is so little and weak that it will vanish and come to naught." Nay, but Christ will cherish it, until he has brought judgment to victory.'

See a flame in a spark, a tree in a seed. See great things in little beginnings. Look not so much to the beginning as to the perfection, and so we shall be, in some degree, joyful in ourselves, and thankful to Christ.

Christ and his church, when they are at the lowest, are nearest rising. His enemies, at the highest, are nearest their downfall. The Jews are not yet come in under Christ's banner; but God who has persuaded Japheth to come into the tents of Shem (Gen. 9: 27) will persuade Shem to come into the tents of Japheth. The ` fullness of the Gentiles' has not yet come in (Rom. 11: 25), but Christ, who has the uttermost parts of the earth given to him for his possession (Psa. 2: 8), will gather all the sheep his Father has given him into one fold, that there may be one sheepfold and one shepherd (John 10: 16). The faithful Jews rejoiced to think of the calling of the Gentiles and why should we not rejoice to think of the calling of the Jews?
