    <h1>Richard Sibbes</h1>
    <br>
   <p>In time of temptation, apprehensive consciences look so much to the present 
    trouble they are in that they need to be roused up to behold him in whom 
     may find rest for their distressed souls. In temptations it is safest to behold
      nothing but Christ the true brazen serpent, the true 'Lamb of God that taketh
       away the sin of the world'" 
       <br>
