    <h1>Teach me Thy way, O Lord</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        Teach me Thy way, O Lord,
        <br>
        Teach me Thy way;
        <br>
      Thy gracious aid afford,
      <br>
        Teach me Thy way.
        <br>
      Help me to walk aright;
      <br>
      More by faith, less by sight;
      <br>
      Lead me with heav’nly light,
      <br>
        Teach me Thy way.
        <br>
        <br>
        When doubts and fears arise,
        <br>
        Teach me Thy way;
        <br>
      When storms o’erspread the skies,
      <br>
        Teach me Thy way.
        <br>
      Shine through the cloud and rain,
      <br>
      Through sorrow, toil, and pain;
      <br>
      Make Thou my pathway plain,
      <br>
        Teach me Thy way.
        <br>
        <br>
        Long as my life shall last,
        <br>
  Teach me Thy way;
  <br>
Where’er my lot be cast,
<br>
  Teach me Thy way.
  <br>
Until the race is run,
<br>
Until the journey’s done,
<br>
Until the crown is won,
<br>
  Teach me Thy way.
