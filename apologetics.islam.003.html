            1500 year old virgin</h1>
   <p class="center">
    <h3>Quran 19:28</h3>
    <p class="center">
    O sister [i.e., descendant] of Aaron, your father was not a man of evil, nor was your mother unchaste."
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Quran 66:12</h3>
    <p class="center">
    And [the example of] Mary, the daughter of ʿImrān, who guarded her chastity, so We blew into [her garment] through Our angel [i.e., Gabriel], and she believed in the words of her Lord and His scriptures and was of the devoutly obedient.

    Mary was not the sister of Aaron, Aaron lived 1500 years earlier than Mary. Mary in Arabic was Miriam. There was another Miriam which Muhammad would have heard about, and she was the daughter of Imran, the brother of Aaron. Miriam the brother of Aaron, and daughter of Imran lived in the times of Moses. But these verses say she was the virgin Mary. Muhmmad didn’t know how to read or write, so he got his information through oral stories. He most likely heard stories about Miriam the brother of Aaron, and stories about the virgin Miriam, and conflated the two Miriams into one Miriam. The virgin Mary was not a descendant of Aaron either, as is supposed. She was a descendant of Judah. It was necessary for the Messiah to be born from the tribe of Judah, but Aaron came from a different tribe.
