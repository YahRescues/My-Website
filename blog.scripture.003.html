<h1 class="center">Let My People Go </h1>
<p class="center">
    Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and tell him that this is what the LORD 
    says: ‘Let My people go, so that they may worship Me. But if you refuse to let them
     go, I will plague your whole country with frogs
     <br>
Exodus 8:1-2
<br>
<br>
God's people were enslaved in Egypt. They were being hindered from serving God. He says
 let My people go so that they may worship me, or He would bring judgement on the system
  which enslaved His people and kept them from truly worshipping Him. Today we have the 
  same thing, the world system is anti-God. It doesn't merely hinder God's people from 
  truly worshipping Him, it is no longer a hinderance. A hinderance would be the bus was
   late but it still came. Today the bus isn't late, it just isn't showing up. What I mean
    is this: It is no longer you can read the Bible, believe it, and pray, but you will
     be mocked. That would be a hinderance. Now it is you can't believe the Bible, you 
     aren't allowed to speak what the Bible says on certain matters, you can't pray
      because you have to do X, Y, and Z instead. Nobody has a gun to your head saying you
       can't pray, but the world system won't allow you time to pray. So, regardless if they
        have a gun to your head or not, the world system is keeping you from praying and 
        having time all alone to yourself with God. It is keeping you from raising your kids
         in a godly environment with biblical standards and morals. It is only so long 
         before God says enough is enough, just like He did in Exodus. This is the work
          God does in us. He works to free us from slavery to sin, so that we will be 
          free to be a slave to Him. After salvation satan is going to come and work to
           free us from slavery to God, and bring us back into slavery to sin. We all 
           have a choice, after the delivery from Egypt, Israel still were told to choose
            for themselves who they would serve.
            <br>
            <br>
Now, therefore, fear the LORD and serve Him in sincerity and truth; cast aside the gods your fathers served beyond the Euphrates and in Egypt, and serve the LORD. But if it is unpleasing in your sight to serve the LORD, then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your fathers served beyond the Euphrates, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living. As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD!” 
Joshua 24:14-15
<br>
<br>
Many times, Israel made the wrong choice, but God was merciful, and when they turned back
 to God, He turned back to them. But when they turned their back on God, He turned His back 
 on them. Meaning when they prayed He wasn't looking upon them to favour them, His face 
 wasn't shining upon them, they didn't have the light of His countenance, but only cursing
  and darkness.
<br>
<br>
So tell the people that this is what the LORD of Hosts says: ‘Return to Me, declares the
 LORD of Hosts, and I will return to you, says the LORD of Hosts.’ Do not be like your
  fathers, to whom the former prophets proclaimed that this is what the LORD of Hosts 
  says: ‘Turn now from your evil ways and deeds.’ But they did not listen or pay attention
   to Me, declares the LORD.
   <br>
Zecheriah 1:3-4
<br>
<br>
Therefore tell the house of Israel that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Repent and turn
 away from your idols; turn your faces away from all your abominations. For when any
  Israelite or any foreigner dwelling in Israel separates himself from Me, sets up idols
   in his heart, and puts a wicked stumbling block before his face, and then comes to the
    prophet to inquire of Me, I the LORD will answer him Myself. I will set My face against
     that man and make him a sign and a proverb; I will cut him off from among My people.
      Then you will know that I am the LORD.
      <br>
Ezekiel 14:6-8
<br>
 <br>
As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and suddenly great terror and darkness
 overwhelmed him.Then the LORD said to Abram, “Know for certain that your descendants will
  be strangers in a land that is not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated 
  four hundred years. But I will judge the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward they
   will depart with many possessions. You, however, will go to your fathers in peace and 
   be buried at a ripe old age. In the fourth generation your descendants will return here,
    for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.”
    <br>
Genesis 15:12-16
<br>
<br>
But God spoke in this way: that his offspring would dwell in a foreign land, and that they
 would enslave them, and they would treat them badly four hundred years. 'And the nation 
 which they will serve, I will judge,' said God, 'and after these things they will come out
  and serve Me in this place.' Then He gave him the covenant of circumcision; and so Abraham
   begot Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot
    the twelve patriarchs. 
    <br>
Acts 7:6-8
<br>
<br>
This goes right back to what was said at the beginning. We have become strangers and aliens
 in our nation. True believer today should feel like a stranger in a foreign land. If prior
  generation could arise and see our nation they wouldn't recognise it. We have become slaves
   to the world system. You can't function as a citizen without technology. You usually need
    a phone number for work, sometimes you might even need social media. These are the kind
     of things which are keeping God's people from a fuller revelation of God. Not having a
      phone number itself, but needing to keep contant tabs on these things isn't good. The
       end result is that God came with judgement to that nation which enslaved His people 
       and they worshipped Him. In this time God is being merciful, though we don't realise,
        we are living in a time of mercy. God will judge by sending no prophet, but still He
         is being merciful, allowing people to repent and giving us times of ease. Many things
          we pray for, God will not answer. His response would be the same as it was to 
          Jeremiah if he prayed for God to unjudge what he had brought judgement upon. Many
           times, we pray to God and ask Him to unjudge what he has brought judgement upon.
            We live under the consequences of sin and rebellion against God, when God brings
             judgement and we don't like the consequences, we pray that He would undo what 
             He has done and is doing. Israel could have prayed that God wouldn't send the 
             plagues, but he would have sent them anyway. Even when Moses prayed and God had
              mercy, it only resulted in a further plague later. We can pray that God would
               heal our nation, but if our nation keeps doing the things which bring the 
               judgement of God it will become sick again. A nation must let Gods people go
                that they may serve him. Our nations today are keeping God's people in 
                bondage, keeping them from serving God. God will bring judgement on whatever
                 keeps His people from serving Him. What if a flood took away access to 
                 electronics? What if there was no internet connection where you are? There
                  is no security outside of Gods shelter, and He will do whatever He has to
                   do to bring His people back to Him. He did whatever He had to do so that
                    Pharaoh let His people go that they may serve Him, and He will do whatever
                     he has to do so that our leaders, and the false gods let us go so that
                      we may truly serve God how He should be served. Change is coming and
                       everything which can be shaken will be shaken, everything which can 
                       be removed will be removed.
<br>
<br>
Open the gates so a righteous nation may enter— one that remains faithful. You will 
keep in perfect peace the steadfast of mind, because he trusts in You. Trust in the
 LORD forever, because GOD the LORD is the Rock eternal. For He has humbled those who dwell
   on high; He lays the lofty city low. He brings it down to the ground; He casts it 
   into the dust. Feet trample it down— the feet of the oppressed, the steps of the 
   poor.
   <br>
Isaiah 26:2-6
<br>
<br>
O LORD our God, other lords besides You have had dominion, but Your name alone do we confess.
Isaiah 26:13
<br>
<br>
We have heard with our ears, O God; our fathers have told us the work You did in their 
days, in the days of old. With Your hand You drove out the nations and planted our fathers
 there; You crushed the peoples and cast them out. For it was not by their sword that they
  took the land; their arm did not bring them victory. It was by Your right hand, Your arm,
   and the light of Your face, because You favored them. You are my King, O God, who 
   ordains victories for Jacob. Through You we repel our foes; through Your name we trample
    our enemies. For I do not trust in my bow, nor does my sword save me. For You save us
     from our enemies; You put those who hate us to shame. In God we have boasted all day
      long, and Your name we will praise forever.
      <br>
Selah
<br>
But You have rejected and humbled us; You no longer go forth with our armies. You have
 made us retreat from the foe, and those who hate us have plundered us. You have given
  us up as sheep to be devoured;You have scattered us among the nations.You sell Your 
  people for nothing; no profit do You gain from their sale. You have made us a reproach
   to our neighbors, a mockery and derision to those around us.You have made us a byword
    among the nations, a laughingstock among the peoples. All day long my disgrace is 
    before me, and shame has covered my face, at the voice of the scorner and reviler,
     because of the enemy, bent on revenge. All this has come upon us, though we have
      not forgotten You or betrayed Your covenant. Our hearts have not turned back; our
       steps have not strayed from Your path. But You have crushed us in the lair of 
       jackals; You have covered us with deepest darkness. If we had forgotten the name
        of our God or spread out our hands to a foreign god, would not God have 
        discovered, since He knows the secrets of the heart? Yet for Your sake we face 
        death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered. Wake up, O
         Lord! Why are You sleeping? Arise! Do not reject us forever. Why do You hide
          Your face and forget our affliction and oppression? For our soul has sunk to
           the dust; our bodies cling to the earth. Rise up; be our help! Redeem us
            on account of Your loving devotion.
            <br>
Psalms 44
<br>
<br>
O LORD, they sought You in their distress; when You disciplined them, they poured out
 a quiet prayer. As a woman with child about to give birth writhes and cries out in pain,
  so were we in Your presence, O LORD. We were with child; we writhed in pain; but we 
  gave birth to wind. We have given no salvation to the earth, nor brought any life into
   the world. Your dead will live; their bodies will rise. Awake and sing, you who dwell
    in the dust! For your dew is like the dew of the morning, and the earth will bring
     forth her dead. Go, my people, enter your rooms and shut your doors behind you. 
     Hide yourselves a little while until the wrath has passed. For behold, the LORD 
     is coming out of His dwelling to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their 
     iniquity. The earth will reveal her bloodshed and will no longer conceal her slain.
     <br>
Isaiah 26:16-21
<br>
<br>
Indeed, You have made the city a heap of rubble, the fortified town a ruin. The fortress 
of strangers is a city no more; it will never be rebuilt. Therefore, a strong people will
 honor You. The cities of ruthless nations will revere You. For You have been a refuge 
 for the poor, a stronghold for the needy in distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade
  from the heat. For the breath of the ruthless is like rain against a wall, like heat
   in a dry land. You subdue the uproar of foreigners. As the shade of a cloud cools the
    heat, so the song of the ruthless is silenced. On this mountain the LORD of Hosts
     will prepare a banquet for all the peoples, a feast of aged wine, of choice meat,
      of finely aged wine. On this mountain He will swallow up the shroud that enfolds
       all peoples, the sheet that covers all nations; He will swallow up death forever.
       The Lord GOD will wipe away the tears from every face and remove the disgrace of
        His people from the whole earth. And in that day it will be said, “Surely this
         is our God; we have waited for Him, and He has saved us. This is the LORD for
          whom we have waited. Let us rejoice and be glad in His salvation.”
          <br>
Isaiah 25:2-9
<br>
<br>
The earth mourns and withers; the world languishes and fades; the exalted of the earth
 waste away. The earth is defiled by its people; they have transgressed the laws; they
  have overstepped the decrees and broken the everlasting covenant. Therefore a curse 
  has consumed the earth, and its inhabitants must bear the guilt; the earth’s dwellers
   have been burned, and only a few survive.
   <br>
Isaiah 24:4-6
<br>
<br>
From the ends of the earth we hear singing: “Glory to the Righteous One.” But I said,
 “I am wasting away! I am wasting away! Woe is me.” The treacherous betray; the
  treacherous deal in treachery. Terror and pit and snare await you, O dweller of the 
  earth.Whoever flees the sound of panic will fall into the pit, and whoever climbs
   from the pit will be caught in the snare. For the windows of heaven are open, and
    the foundations of the earth are shaken. The earth is utterly broken apart, the
     earth is split open, the earth is shaken violently. The earth staggers like a 
     drunkard and sways like a shack. Earth’s rebellion weighs it down, and it falls,
      never to rise again.
      <br>
Isaiah 24:16-20
<br>
<br>
He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty
<br>
Psalms 91:1
<br>
<br>
“Because he loves Me, I will deliver him; because he knows My name, I will protect him. 
When he calls out to Me, I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble. I will deliver
 him and honor him. With long life I will satisfy him and show him My salvation.”
 <br>
Psalms 91:14-16
<br>
<br>
See that you do not refuse Him who speaks. For if they did not escape, having refused
 Him who warned them, how much more shall we not escape if we turn away from Him who 
 warns from heaven; whose voice then shook the earth; but now He has promised, saying, 
 "Yet once more I shake not only the earth, but also the heaven." Now the phrase, "Yet
  once more," signifies the removal of the things being shaken, as having been made, 
  so that the things which cannot be shaken may remain. Therefore, since we are receiving
an unshakable kingdom, let us have grace, through which we serve God acceptably with 
reverence and godly fear. For our God is a consuming fire. 
<br>
Hebrews 12:25-29
<br>
<br>
But in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us. For I am 
convinced that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor
 things present nor things to come,  nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing,
  shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. 
  <br>
Romans 8:37-39
