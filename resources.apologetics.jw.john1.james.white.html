        <h1>An Excerpt From the Forgotten Trinity</h1>
        <br>
    <p class="center">
        Monotheism in the Bible-certainly it cannot be argued that John would use the 
        very word he always uses of the one true God, OEOS, of one who is simply a 
        "godlike" one or a lesser "god." The Scriptures do not teach that there exists
         a whole host of intermediate beings that can truly be called "gods." That is
          gnosticism.
<br>
<br>
        The anarthrous BEOs -If one is to dogmatically assert that any anarthrous noun
         must be indefinite and translated with an indefinite article, one must be able
          to do the same with the 282 other times OF6; appears anarthrously. For an
           example of the chaos that would create, try translating the anarthrous OEoS
            at 2 Corinthians 5:19 (i.e., "a god was in Christ. . ."). What is more, 
            Oeog appears many times in the prologue of John anarthrously, yet no one
             argues that in these instances it should be translated "a god." Note
              verses 6, 12, 13, and 18. There is simply no warrant in the language to
               do this. 16
        <br>
        <br>
        No room for alternate understanding-It ignores a basic tenet of translation: 
        if you are going to insist on a translation, you must be prepared to defend 
        it in such a way so as to provide a way for the author to have expressed the
         alternate translation. In other words, if 06; rlv o Xoyo; is "the Word was 
         a god," how could John have said "the Word was God?" We have already seen 
         that if John had employed the article before OE6;, he would have made the 
         terms OE6; and Xoyo; interchangeable, amounting to modalism.
         <br>
        <br>
        Ignores the context-The translation tears the phrase from the immediately
         preceding context, leaving it alone and useless. Can He who is eternal 
         (first clause) and who has always been with God (second clause), and who 
         created all things (verse 3), be "a god"?
         <br>
        <br>
        F. F. Bruce sums up the truth pretty well:
        <br>
        <br>
        It is nowhere more sadly true than in the acquisition of Greek that "a little
         learning is a dangerous thing." The uses of the Greek article, the functions
          of Greek prepositions, and the fine distinctions between Greek tenses are
           confidently expounded in public at times by men who find considerable
            difficulty in using these parts of speech accurately in their native 
            tongue."
        <br>
        <br>
        A footnote appears after the comment on the article, and it says:
        <br>
        <br>
        Those people who emphasize that the true rendering of the last clause of 
        John 1.1 is "the word was a god," prove nothing thereby save their ignorance
         of Greek grammar.
<br>
<br>
So our decision, then, must be between the definite understanding of the word and the
 qualitative. If we take AEOS as definite, we are hardpressed to avoid the same 
 conclusion that we would reach if the word had the article; that is, if we wish to say
  the God in the same way as if the word had the article, we are making Oe/o and Xoyog
   interchangeable. Yet the vast majority of translations render the phrase "the Word 
   was God." Is this not the definite translation? Not necessarily.
<br>
<br>
The last clause of John 1:1 tells us about the nature of the Word. The translation 
should be qualitative. We have already seen in the words of F. F. Bruce that John is
 telling us that the Word "shared the nature and being of God."18 The New English Bible
  renders the phrase "what God was, the Word was." Kenneth Wuest puts it, "And the Word
   was as to His essence absolute deity."19 Yet Daniel Wallace is quite right when he 
   notes:
   <br>
   <br>
Although I believe that OeoS in 1:1 c is qualitative, I think the simplest and most
 straightforward translation is, "and the Word was God."
 <br>
 <br>
It may be better to clearly affirm the NT teaching of the deity of Christ and then
 explain that he is not the Father, than to sound ambiguous on his deity and explain
  that he is God but is not the Father.20
<br>
<br>
Here we encounter another instance where the English translation is not quite up to
 the Greek original. We must go beyond a basic translation and ask what John himself meant.
<br>
<br>
In summary, then, what do we find in John 1:1? In a matter of only seventeen short Greek
 words, John communicates the following truths:
 <br>
 <br>
The Word is eternal-He has always existed and did not come into existence at a point
 in time.
<br>
<br>
The Word is personal-He is not a force, but a person, and that eternally. He has always
 been in communion with the Father
 <br>
 <br>
 The Word is deity-The Word is God as to His nature.
 <br>
<br>
We would all do well to communicate so much in so few words! But he did not stop at
 verse 1. This is but the first verse of an entire composition. We move on to examine
  the rest.
