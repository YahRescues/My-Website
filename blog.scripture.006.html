    And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God
<br>
    Matthew 19:24
<br>
<br>
You can use a synonym there and say it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man, an American, and English man, to enter the kingdom. We have more than most of the world. When some miss a meal we say they are in poverty, and by our standard of living they are. But in Biblical times they only ate twice a day, and many people in the world would love the chance to eat twice every single day, they would love to shower every single day, they would love to live in our mansions, which we call small houses. Whilst there are those living in mud huts, places with one room, we grumble at our small mansions. When these things are shaken in our lives we immediately think we are in poverty, and that the government is obligated to fund our luxurious way of living. Our god has become man, the government, or anybody who will fund our desires and wants, and we end up submitting to the government in order for them to give us what we want. 
<br>
<br>
Assuredly I say to you, unless you are converted and become as little children, you shall by no means enter the kingdom of heaven.
<br>
Matthew 18:3
<br>
<br>
What we also see is that Jesus uses a camel, the largest unclean animal, to refer to the ones who would get into the kingdom before these rich people. To get through the eye of a needle, you have to become nothing, you have to be humble. What we see is that it would be more likely that pagans would become nothing and enter the kingdom, than these rich men who refuse to become nothing, to enter the kingdom. We see after that, the first will be last, and the last first. This is the basis of the parable beginning at Matthew 20. 
<br>
<br>
"But what do you think? A man had two children. And having come to the first, he said, 'Child, go, work today in my vineyard.' "But he answered and said, 'I will not,' but later he regretted it and went. And having come to the other, he said likewise. And he answered and said, 'I am going, sir,' but he did not go. Which of the two did the will of his father?" They said to Him, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Assuredly I say to you, that tax collectors and harlots enter the kingdom of God before you. For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him; but tax collectors and harlots believed him; but you, having seen, did not repent afterwards, that you might believe him. 
<br>
Matthew 21:28-32
<br>
<br>
For everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, and he who humbles himself shall be exalted.
<br>
Luke 14:11
<br>
<br>
But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.
<br>
Matthew 19:30
<br>
<br>
“For the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard. After agreeing with the workers that they would each receive a denarius for the day, he sent them into his vineyard. About the third hour he went out and saw others standing idle in the marketplace. He said to them, ‘You go into my vineyard as well, and I will give you whatever is right.’ So they went. He went out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour and did likewise. About the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle and said to them, ‘Why have you been standing here idle all day?’ They said to him, ‘Because no one has hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You go into my vineyard as well, and you will receive whatever is right.’ “When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, ‘Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last and going on to the first.’ When those who had been hired about the eleventh hour came, they each received a denarius. So when those who had been hired first came, they thought they would receive more, but they also each received a denarius. When they received it, they grumbled against the master of the house, saying, ‘These last men worked for one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.’ But he replied to one of them, ‘Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me to work for a denarius? Take what is yours and go. I wish to give to this last man just as I gave to you. Or is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with what is mine? Are you envious because I am good?’ So the last will be first, and the first will be last. For many are called, but few are chosen.” 
<br>
Matthew 20:1-16
<br>
<br>
Men were found to work for the kingdom, and agreed upon their wage, some were hired in the third hour, some the sixth, some the ninth. But when it got to the eleventh hour, there were still more whom nobody would hire. These are the ones nobody would go near, were ignored by society, ignored and deemed as less by those at the top of the hierarchy in the religious world, and for this cause had become nothing, and humble. At the end of the 12 hours each was given his wage, beginning with the last. Those who were hired last, had done the least amount of work, and by appearance had the least to offer to God, they are the ones who were called into the kingdom first. Those who had done the most amount of works, likely those deemed as great in the religious world, at the top of the hierarchy, back then then it was the Pharisees, but today it is the pastors, teachers, preachers, theologians, authors, those always in the public eye doing great things for the kingdom, they are the ones called in last. It wasn't because they had done those great things, or the lack of those great things that the last were called in first. But those things hindered them from being humble, and the lack of those things hindered the last from being puffed up. He is speaking in general terms, that there are many who are first in this life, who will be last in the next, many who are greatest in the kingdom of earth, will be deemed least in the kingdom of heaven. The great test of this is when you are deemed as equal to somebody less than you in the hierarchy.  Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. These last were more concerned with building up out of love, these first were more concerned with the knowledge they had and couldn't possibly be wrong about anything. These men, who were esteemed as great, supposed they were better than the last. This is a damning rebuke to every pastor, or leader, who thinks they are better than the old widow who sits quietly in their congregation, or the new believer who doesn't know much, but is trying their best. These first grumbled that they could be deemed as equal to the last. Their complaint is that the last worked for one hour, whilst they did for 12, that they had endured more, worked more, and these last came in right at the end, didn't do much, but were deemed equal to them. He never tells those who came in at the end 'take what is yours and go’ but to those who complained, and thought they were better he says 'take what is yours and go’ and that 'many are called but few are chosen'. Many are called to come and work for the kingdom, but how many were chosen, evidenced in their humble endurance, esteeming others as greater than themselves. Their is always an exception to the rule, the parables are generalisations, there will always be a pastor, a leader, a teacher, an author, who gets the message, and remains humble, but it is much harder, and it is much easier for a pagan to become humble and enter in, than for these first to remain in the same humble condition they were in at the beginning. It is difficult, a hard pressed way that leads to life, and few find it. Before anybody hired them, they would have been humble, but something got to them, some pride got in the way and wasn't immediately cast down, the bad seed was watered and blossomed, until at last their was evil fruit, and their eye was evil, meaning they were no longer seeing things how God sees them.

<br>
So if there is any encouragement in Christ, if there is any comfort from love, if there is any fellowship in the Spirit, if there is any compassion or mercy, make my joy complete by adopting the same mindset, having the same love, being united in spirit, and having one purpose.  Do nothing from selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility regard others as more important than yourselves. None of you should look out for your own interests, but for the interests of others. Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus, 
<br>
Philippians 2:1-5
<br>
<br>
How narrow is the gate, and restricted the way that leads to life, and there are few who find it!

<br>
strengthening the souls of the disciples, urging them to continue in the faith, saying, "Through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God."
