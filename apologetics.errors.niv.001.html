        <h1>Does the Bible punish women for rape?</h1>
   <p class="center">
    Deuteronomy 22:22-29 says “If a man is found lying with another man’s wife, both the man who slept with her and the woman must die. You must purge the evil from Israel. If there is a virgin pledged in marriage to a man, and another man encounters her in the city and sleeps with her, you must take both of them out to the gate of that city and stone them to death—the young woman because she did not cry out in the city, and the man because he has violated his neighbor’s wife. So you must purge the evil from among you. But if the man encounters a betrothed woman in the open country, and he overpowers her and lies with her, only the man who has done this must die. Do nothing to the young woman, because she has committed no sin worthy of death. This case is just like one in which a man attacks his neighbor and murders him. When he found her in the field, the betrothed woman cried out, but there was no one to save her. If a man encounters a virgin who is not pledged in marriage, and he seizes her and lies with her, and they are discovered, then the man who lay with her must pay the young woman’s father fifty shekels of silver, and she must become his wife because he has violated her. He must not divorce her as long as he lives”

    In the NIV instead of ‘seizes her and lies with her’ it says if a man rapes a woman she is required to marry him. The error is not with the Bible, it is with the translation in the NIV. It should say, as most do, if he takes hold of her and sleeps with her. In this case it is with consent, we can see this clearly from the context. V23-24 speaks of a married woman sleeping with another man with consent. V25-27 speaks of the married woman and a man who forces her to sleep with him, this would be rape. In V25-27 it clearly says the woman isn’t punished for this man’s sins just like when a man rises against his neighbour to kill him. The Bible condemns forcing sex without consent. When we get to V28-29 it is a different Hebrew word, and a different scenario, just as V23-24 was different. It says if a man sleeps with another woman who is not married then he is to marry her. This is obviously with consent because it condemns the man who sleeps with a woman without consent.
