        <h1>Hearing or not hearing?</h1>
   <p class="center">
    And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man
<br>
    Acts 9:7 KJV
<br>
<br>
And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid; but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me
<br>
Acts 22:9 KJV
<br>
<br>
“And those who were with me beheld the light, to be sure, but did not understand the voice of the One who was speaking to me.
<br>
Acts 22:9 NASB
<br>
<br>
The KJV and the NKJV have 2 contradicting statements. One verse says they heard a voice, the other says they did not hear the voice. The only way to explain it is by saying they heard another voice, but it wasn’t the voice of Jesus. This leads to another question, whose voice did they hear? How do you know? The solution to the difference is that although the same Greek word is used, it is not used in the same way. The root word is the same but the grammar is different. Words have a range of meaning, they don’t always mean the same thing every time. If you want to say something a little different you don’t need to use a completely different root word, you can just change the grammar. We have words in English which appear the same but can mean different things. It is understood that in Acts 9:7 Luke is telling the story of Paul and states that they heard a voice. In acts 22:9 Paul is telling his own story and states that they didn’t understand what the voice was telling him. From the two passages we get that they saw only a light but Paul saw Jesus, they heard a voice but didn’t understand, Paul heard the voice and understood.
