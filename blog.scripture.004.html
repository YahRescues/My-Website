<h1 class="center">The way, the truth, and the life</h1>
<p class="center">

Jesus said to him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father
 except through Me. 
 <br>
John 14:6
<br>
<br>
This verse is something to contemplate on. First of all notice how He says no one 
comes to the Father through Me, and also that He is the way, the truth, and the life.
 In other words, nobody comes to the Father except through the way, the truth and the
  life. There is no way to the Father without the truth. He doesn't merely give us
   guidance, truth, and life, He is those things for us. He is our life. We may ask
    what is the way? It is Jesus. God doesn't need you to figure everything out. He
     isn't sitting in Heaven anticipating if you will figure out the solution to lifes 
     problems. If anything, He is waiting for you to figure out that He is God. He is
      waiting for you to just focus upon Him. He is the answer, He is the way. 
      <br>
<br>
If He is the way, the truth and the life, then with Him we have a way to the Father,
 a narrow way which few travel on, we have truth to not be deceived, and we have life
  that we might not remain in death. If He gives us these things, then remaining close
   to Him, He will continue to guide us to these things in greater measures. By this
    logic an anti-christ is going to bring us to a broad way which many travel, a way
     which doesn't lead to the Father, deception and delusions, and death. If we remain
      close to an anti-christ and accept him as our shepherd he will bring us these
       things in greater degrees. By these things we can test if we have been following 
       the wrong voice. Perhaps everybody has listened to the wrong voice as some point.
        We most certainly don't always hear the right voice.
        <br>
<br>
 I am the door. If anyone enters by Me, he will be saved, and will go in and go out,
  and will find pasture. The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to
   destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.
   <br>
John 10:9-10
<br>
<br>
If Jesus is the door, then an anti-christ poses as a door. We see many anti-christs
 todaay posing as a door, as an enterance to find God. We see many doors today, a lot 
 of which look the same. We see doors which we know to be false in other religions and
  obvious heresies, but there are more doors which look identical to the right door.
   There are many doors to enter, but only one door is the right one. If we go through 
   the wrong one we must go out of it again and come back to the right door. Once you 
   go through the right door, the  devil will try to convince you that you went through
    the wrong one, and we see many leaving the ancient paths for a highway to hell,
     forsaking the fountain of living waters for broken cisterns which can hold no
      water. When hard times come they have nothing because they dumbed the Bible down
       to one doctrine and rejected all of the other truths which is teaches. Those
        other doors may appear to have shelter, but only one has a shelter which will 
        not perish. The devil will try to convince you to leave the correct door for
         the wrong door, "it looks fun, how could that many people be deceived? Surely
          this person couldn't be deceived? Do you really want to stay here by yourself?
           You are just making things difficult for yourself? It would be so much easier
            if you just went through the other door. Maybe both doors are okay." This
             is the voice of the enemy. it goes against the voice of God in scripture.
              There is one door, Jesus is that door, beware of anything which keeps you
               from Him, any doctrine that keeps you from freedom, any belief which is 
               popular and forced onto the entire population, any interest which is more
                interesting than God, or the Bible. 
                <br>

“For My people have committed two evils: They have forsaken Me, the fountain of living
 water, and they have dug their own cisterns— broken cisterns that cannot hold water.
 <br>
Jeremiah 2:13
