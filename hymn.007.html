    <br>
    <p class="center">
        My faith has found a resting place,
        <br>
  Not in device nor creed;
  <br>
I trust the Ever-living One,
<br>
  His wounds for me shall plead.
  <br>
  <br>
  I need no other argument,
  <br>
  I need no other plea;
  <br>
It is enough that Jesus died,
<br>
    And that He died for me.
    <br>
    <br>
    Enough for me that Jesus saves,
    <br>
    This ends my fear and doubt;
    <br>
  A sinful soul I come to Him,
  <br>
    He’ll never cast me out.
    <br>
    <br>
    My heart is leaning on the Word,
    <br>
  The written Word of God,
  <br>
Salvation by my Savior’s name,
<br>
  Salvation through His blood.
  <br>
  <br>
  My great Physician heals the sick,
  <br>
  The lost He came to save;
  <br>
For me His precious blood He shed,
<br>
  For me His life He gave.
