        <h1>An Excerpt From the Forgotten Trinity</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="center">

            The following is an excerpt from James White's book 'the forgotten trinity' This excerpt 
            takes the discussion of John 1:1. Whilst it contains some Greek which might be hard to understand, it gives a clear defence for John 1:1.
            <br>
            <br>
            The third clause of John 1:1 provides us with an example of what is known in grammar as a predicate nominative construction. 1Â° That is, we have a noun, the subject of the clause, which is "the Word." We have an "equative" or "copulative" verb, "was," and we have another noun, in the same case or form as the subject, which is called the nominative case, that being "God." We need to realize that in Greek the order in which words appear is not nearly as important as it is in English. The Greeks had no problem putting the subject of a sentence, or its main verb, way down the line, so to speak. Just because one word comes before another in Greek does not necessarily have any significance. What does this have to do with John 1:1? Well, in English, the final phrase would be literally rendered, "God was the Word." But in English, we put the subject first, and the predicate nominative later. The Greeks used the article to communicate to us which word is the subject, and which is the predicate. If one of the two nouns has the article, it is the subject. In this case, "Word" has the article, even though it comes after "God," and hence is our subject. That is why the last phrase is translated "the Word was God" rather than "God was the Word."
            <br>
            <br>
            Stay with me now, for there is another important point to be seen in the text. If both of the nouns in a predicate nominative construction like this one have the article, or if both lack the article, this is significant as well. In that case, the two nouns become interchangeable. That is, if "Word" had the article, and "God" did, too, this would mean that John is saying that "God was the Word" and the "Word was God." Both would be the same thing. Or, if neither of them had the article, we would have the same idea: an equating of all of God with all of the Word. "God" and "Word" would be interchangeable and equal terms.
            <br>
            <br>
            You see, much has been made, especially by Jehovah's Witnesses, of the fact that the word "God" in the last clause of John 1:1 is anarthrous, that is, without the article. You will notice that there is no form of the Greek article preceding the term AEOS (theos). Because of this, they argue that we should translate it "a god." This completely misses the point of why the word theos does not have the article. If John had put the article before theos, he would have been teaching modalism, a belief we mentioned earlier that denies the existence of three divine persons, saying there is only one person who sometimes acts like the Father, sometimes like the Son, sometimes like the Spirit. We will discuss modalism (which is also often called "Sabellianism") later. For now, we see that if John had placed the article before theos, he would have been making "God" and the "Word" equal and interchangeable terms. As we will see, John is very careful to differentiate between these terms here, for He is careful to differentiate between the Father and the Son throughout the entire Gospel of John."
            <br>
            <br>
            One commentator has rightly noted regarding the prologue, "John is not trying to show who is God, but who is the Word."2 The final phrase tells us about the Word, emphasizing the nature of the Word. F. F. Bruce's comments on this passage are valuable:
            <br>
            <br>
            The structure of the third clause in verse 1, theos en ho logos, demands the translation "The Word was God." Since logos has the article preceding it, it is marked out as the subject. The fact that theos is the first word after the conjunction kai (and) shows that the main emphasis of the clause lies on it. Had theos as well as logos been preceded by the article the meaning would have been that the Word was completely identical with God, which is impossible if the Word was also "with God." What is meant is that the Word shared the nature and being of God, or (to use a piece of modern jargon) was an extension of the personality of God. The NEB paraphrase "what God was, the Word was," brings out the meaning of the clause as successfully as a paraphrase can."
            <br>
            <br>
            In the same way, the New Living Translation renders John 1:1, "In the beginning the Word already existed. He was with God, and he was God."
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>INDEFINITE, DEFINITE, QUALITATIVE, OR WHAT?</h2>
            Before leaving John 1:1, we need to wrestle with the controversy that surrounds how to translate the final phrase. We've touched a bit on it above, but it would be good to lay out the possibilities. Without going into all the issues," the possible renderings fall into three categories:
<br>
<br>
Indefinite: hence, "a god."
<br>
<br>
Definite: hence, "God."
<br>
<br>
Qualitative: hence, "in nature God."
<br>
<br>
Arguments abound about how to translate an "anarthrous preverbal predicate nominative," and most people get lost fairly quickly when you start throwing terms like those around. Basically, the question we have to ask is this: how does John intend us to take the word OEOg in the last clause? Does he wish us to understand it as indefinite, so that no particular "god" is in mind, but instead, that Jesus is a god, one of at least two, or even more?" Or is OEOS definite, so that the God is in view? Or does the position of the word (before the verb, adding emphasis), coupled with the lack of the article, indicate that John is directing us to a quality when he says the Word is 6E6S? That is, is John describing the nature of the Word, saying the Word is deity?
<br>
<br>
In reference to the first possibility, we can dismiss it almost immediately. The reasons are as follows:
    <br>
    <br>        
            Monotheism in the Bible-certainly it cannot be argued that John would use the 
            very word he always uses of the one true God, OEOS, of one who is simply a 
            "godlike" one or a lesser "god." The Scriptures do not teach that there exists
             a whole host of intermediate beings that can truly be called "gods." That is
              gnosticism.
    <br>
    <br>
            The anarthrous BEOs -If one is to dogmatically assert that any anarthrous noun
             must be indefinite and translated with an indefinite article, one must be able
              to do the same with the 282 other times OF6; appears anarthrously. For an
               example of the chaos that would create, try translating the anarthrous OEoS
                at 2 Corinthians 5:19 (i.e., "a god was in Christ. . ."). What is more, 
                Oeog appears many times in the prologue of John anarthrously, yet no one
                 argues that in these instances it should be translated "a god." Note
                  verses 6, 12, 13, and 18. There is simply no warrant in the language to
                   do this. 16
            <br>
            <br>
            No room for alternate understanding-It ignores a basic tenet of translation: 
            if you are going to insist on a translation, you must be prepared to defend 
            it in such a way so as to provide a way for the author to have expressed the
             alternate translation. In other words, if 06; rlv o Xoyo; is "the Word was 
             a god," how could John have said "the Word was God?" We have already seen 
             that if John had employed the article before OE6;, he would have made the 
             terms OE6; and Xoyo; interchangeable, amounting to modalism.
             <br>
            <br>
            Ignores the context-The translation tears the phrase from the immediately
             preceding context, leaving it alone and useless. Can He who is eternal 
             (first clause) and who has always been with God (second clause), and who 
             created all things (verse 3), be "a god"?
             <br>
            <br>
            F. F. Bruce sums up the truth pretty well:
            <br>
            <br>
            It is nowhere more sadly true than in the acquisition of Greek that "a little
             learning is a dangerous thing." The uses of the Greek article, the functions
              of Greek prepositions, and the fine distinctions between Greek tenses are
               confidently expounded in public at times by men who find considerable
                difficulty in using these parts of speech accurately in their native 
                tongue."
            <br>
            <br>
            A footnote appears after the comment on the article, and it says:
            <br>
            <br>
            Those people who emphasize that the true rendering of the last clause of 
            John 1.1 is "the word was a god," prove nothing thereby save their ignorance
             of Greek grammar.
    <br>
    <br>
    So our decision, then, must be between the definite understanding of the word and the
     qualitative. If we take AEOS as definite, we are hardpressed to avoid the same 
     conclusion that we would reach if the word had the article; that is, if we wish to say
      the God in the same way as if the word had the article, we are making Oe/o and Xoyog
       interchangeable. Yet the vast majority of translations render the phrase "the Word 
       was God." Is this not the definite translation? Not necessarily.
    <br>
    <br>
    The last clause of John 1:1 tells us about the nature of the Word. The translation 
    should be qualitative. We have already seen in the words of F. F. Bruce that John is
     telling us that the Word "shared the nature and being of God."18 The New English Bible
      renders the phrase "what God was, the Word was." Kenneth Wuest puts it, "And the Word
       was as to His essence absolute deity."19 Yet Daniel Wallace is quite right when he 
       notes:
       <br>
       <br>
    Although I believe that OeoS in 1:1 c is qualitative, I think the simplest and most
     straightforward translation is, "and the Word was God."
     <br>
     <br>
    It may be better to clearly affirm the NT teaching of the deity of Christ and then
     explain that he is not the Father, than to sound ambiguous on his deity and explain
      that he is God but is not the Father.20
    <br>
    <br>
    Here we encounter another instance where the English translation is not quite up to
     the Greek original. We must go beyond a basic translation and ask what John himself meant.
    <br>
    <br>
    In summary, then, what do we find in John 1:1? In a matter of only seventeen short Greek
     words, John communicates the following truths:
     <br>
     <br>
    The Word is eternal-He has always existed and did not come into existence at a point
     in time.
    <br>
    <br>
    The Word is personal-He is not a force, but a person, and that eternally. He has always
     been in communion with the Father
     <br>
     <br>
     The Word is deity-The Word is God as to His nature.
     <br>
    <br>
    We would all do well to communicate so much in so few words! But he did not stop at
     verse 1. This is but the first verse of an entire composition. We move on to examine
      the rest."
