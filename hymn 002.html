        <br>
        <br>
        Take my life and let it be
        <br>
        consecrated, Lord, to thee.
        <br>
        Take my moments and my days;
        <br>
        let them flow in endless praise,
        <br>
        let them flow in endless praise.
        <br>
        <br>
        Take my hands and let them move
        <br>
        at the impulse of thy love.
        <br>
        Take my feet and let them be
        <br>
        swift and beautiful for thee,
        <br>
        swift and beautiful for thee.
        <br>
        <br>
        Take my voice and let me sing
        <br>
        always, only, for my King.
        <br>
        Take my lips and let them be
        <br>
        filled with messages from thee,
        <br>
        filled with messages from thee.
        <br>
        <br>
        Take my silver and my gold;
        <br>
        not a mite would I withhold.
        <br>
        Take my intellect and use
        <br>
        every power as thou shalt choose,
        <br>
        every power as thou shalt choose.
        <br>
        <br>
        Take my will and make it thine;
        <br>
        it shall be no longer mine.
        <br>
        Take my heart it is thine own;
        <br>
        it shall be thy royal throne,
        <br>
        it shall be thy royal throne.
        <br>
        <br>
        Take my love; my Lord, I pour
        <br>
        at thy feet its treasure store.
        <br>
        Take myself, and I will be
        <br>
        ever, only, all for thee,
        <br>
        ever, only, all for thee.
