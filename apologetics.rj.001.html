        <h1>7 objections regarding Isaiah 53</h1>
   <p class="center">

    There is a claim in Rabbinical Judaism that Israel is the servant in Isaiah 53, that Israel is the suffering servant. 
    Below are 7 objections to this.
    <br>
    <br>

1) “When we see him” how can Israel see Israel?
2) “There is no beauty that we should desire him” this implies Israel could desire Israel. 
3) “We hid our faces from him” how could Israel hide its face from Israel?
4) How can Israel be referred to as the righteous servant when she was exiled twice because of her sins? All one has to do is read the history of Israel recorded by the Jewish people to see that this was not a righteous servant. They stoned and persecuted the prophets who came to rebuke Israel. A mere skim through the books of Judges, Kings, Chronicles, and the Prophets will answer the question. 
5) This idea would be close to the doctrine of purgatory. That is, suffering for your own sins. How much do you need to suffer to atone for your sins? Who determines how much suffering is enough? What if Israel had suffered enough and then she sins again? Who will atone for her sins? 
6) If one can believe that sin can be atoned for through a human being, what is so hard to believe that sin was atoned for through the Messiah? This doctrine is close to calling Israel her own Messiah. Those who believe this must believe that a man in a past generation atoned for the sins they are committing today. 
7) The way that sin is atoned for is through an innocent victim. Innocent blood must be that which atones for sin. Israel’s blood was not innocent. Any sin Israel commits disqualifies her from being the atonement for her own sins. If she had never sinned she wouldn’t need atonement. The fact that she needs atonement proves that she herself cannot be the atonement. There is only one who was sinless, who could atone for sins, and He did. The Messiah came, Israel is called to believe in Him, and look upon Him whom they pierced. Jews all around the world are doing this, and will continue to do it.
