        <h1>Apologetics and its importance</h1>
   <p class="center">
    but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts. Always be ready to make a defense to anyone who asks you for an explanation of the hope you have within you, with gentleness and respect, 
    <br>
    1 Peter 3:15
    <br>
    <br>
    It is right for me to think this way about you all, since I have you in my heart. For you all share with me in God's grace, both in my imprisonment and in my defense and confirmation of the gospel. 
    <br>
    Philippians 1:7
    <br>
    <br>
    The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel.
    <br>
    Philippians 1:17
    <br>
    <br>
    “Brothers and fathers, listen to the defense I now make to you.” 
    <br>
    Acts 22:1
    <h3>What is apologetics?</h3>
    We get apologetics from the Greek word apologia. The verses above give an idea of what the word means. It isn’t to apologise and make excuses for God. He doesn’t need anybody to make up excuses for Him. Apologia is to give a defence/answer. 
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>How important is apologetics?</h3>
    <p class="center">
        Apologetics has its place in our walk. Before witnessing to a Muslim it would be helpful to be familiar with some common arguments and how to answer them. The same goes for Jehovah Witnesses, Atheism, etc. But we don’t need to know everything there is to know about every different religion and belief. This would take up most of our time. There has never been more attacks on the faith than our day. In the reformation it was Roman Catholicism. You could become very familiar with their beliefs and how to defend the faith. But in our day the good isn’t best. Whilst it is good to know these things what is better is to know God and sit at the feet of the Messiah, listening to His teaching. 
    <br>

    We should also remember that there is no ministry of apologetics, no gift of apologetics. Therefore apologetics doesn’t come from gifting but from learning, and some are capable of learning better than others, some have the capacity to remember more information than others, and some have more time to give to it than others. We are at liberty as to how much we learn. It would be better to know a little about everything, than to know everything about a little. If you knew everything about the resurrection you could be stumped at questions regarding the Deity of Christ. As there is no office or gift of apologetics, we should be firmly established in the fundamental doctrines of the faith first. Becoming too familiar with objections to fundamental doctrines, before being firmly established in them could cause doubt. But if one is firmly established first, then they will be able to answer the devil with ‘it is written’.
